But when she wakes up, the girl in the next bed is not the person who was sleeping there the evening before. And the new building outside her window seems to have metamorphosed into a huge, dark cedar tree! Somehow, Charlotte has slipped back forty years.</p><p>Penelope Farmer lives in Birmingham and has two grown-up children. She is the author of many books, including <b>A Castle of Bone</b> and <b>The Summer Birds</b>.&#x201c;[<i>Charlotte Sometimes</i>] has all the pleasures of a good time-travel yarn...Adolescence is all about forging an identity, and this novel speaks to those questions&nbsp;of &#x2018;who am I?&#x2019; and &#x2018;how do other people see me?&#x2019; in an abstract, haunting&nbsp;way...For those of you with middle-grade children, I recommend&nbsp;<i>Charlotte</i>&nbsp;<i>Sometimes&nbsp;</i>wholeheartedly, and for those of you who may have read it as a child,&nbsp;I recommend returning to it, if only because rereading is one of the only forms of&nbsp;time travel available to us.&#x201d; &#x2014;Hannah Gersen,&nbsp;<i>The Millions</i><br><br>"An intriguing fantasy."&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;<i>The Horn Book<br></i><br>"...[A] book of quite exceptional distinction...the author has built a haunting, convincing story which comes close to being a masterpiece of its kind...not easily forgotten."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Christian Science Monitor<br></i><br>"Farmer writes with style.

An ill-assorted collection of castoffs, 4-Fs, no-accounts, farm boys, and brawlers with not much more than a few minor league games under their belts, the team was playing professional ball for only one reason: the best players had been drafted or had enlisted. Adding to the drama, these misfits were facing the fabled St. Louis Cardinals and their mvp, Stan Musial, one of the greatest hitters in baseball history. The story of this unlikely meeting between crosstown rivals&#x2014;dubbed the &#x201c;Streetcar Series&#x201d; because so many fans took the trolley to Sportsman&#x2019;s Park&#x2014;is told here for the first time.<p>Mining a treasure trove of coverage, including on-the-spot commentary by the Hall of Fame sportswriter Bob Broeg, the authors bring this contest between baseball&#x2019;s David and Goliath vividly to life, giving readers a sense of what this suspenseful six-day series must have meant both to those on the homefront and U.S. servicemen around the world. A marvel of American sportsmanship, patriotism, and boyish innocence, the Streetcar Series will forever be remembered as the best and the &#x201c;worst&#x201d; of an era long past.</p></p><p>John Heidenry is a native of St. Louis and the founding editor of <i>St. Louis Magazine</i>. He is the author of <i>Theirs Was the Kingdom</i> and <i>What Wild Ecstasy</i>. Brett Topel is a freelance sports journalist and an adjunct professor of journalism at Adelphi University. He is also the art director of <i>The Week</i> magazine.Baseball's St. Louis Browns, a team that had never won anything, took advantage of the depletion of the game's stars during World War II to win the American League pennant and then nearly win the World Series against their cross-town rivals, the Cardinals. Heidenry and Topel have compiled a very entertaining history of one of baseball's most improbable, inspiring, and occasionally comic moments. Drawing only on players unsuitable for military service, the Browns boasted, for example, a catcher who would pass out if he gazed upward to catch a pop foul. The Browns won the pennant by a single game, and their starting pitcher in the regular season finale was Sig Jakucki, a legendary drinker and brawler. He promised he wouldn't imbibe the <i>night</i> before the big game but couldn't resist a taste or two the <i>morning</i> before the first pitch. Such was wartime baseball, fondly chronicled in all its idiosyncratic charm by two writers who understand that, in its best moments, baseball appeals most when its underdog egalitarianism takes center stage. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Ryan was certain of it the moment she saw the house on the cliff. It was stone gray and solitary. It turned its back on the Pacific. It wasn't a symmetrical structure, but rambling, with sections of varying heights rising up here and there, giving it a wild sort of grace. High at the top of a winding cliff road, with the backdrop of an angry sky, the house was both magnificent and eerie.<br><br>Like something out of an old movie, Ryan decided as she shifted into first to take the climb. She had heard Pierce Atkins was eccentric. The house seemed to testify to that.<br><br>All it needs, she mused, is a thunderclap, a little fog and the howl of a wolf; just some minor special effects. Amused at the thought, she drew the car to a stop and looked the house over again. You wouldn't see many like it only a hundred and fifty miles north of L.A. You wouldn't, she corrected silently, see many like it anywhere.<br><br>The moment she slid from the car, the wind pulled at her, whipping her hair around her face and tugging at her skirt. She was tempted to go to the seawall and take a look at the ocean but hurried up the steps instead. She hadn't come to admire the view.<br><br>The knocker was old and heavy. It gave a very impressive thud when she pounded it against the door. Ryan told herself she wasn't the least bit nervous but switched her briefcase from hand to hand as she waited. Her father would be furious if she walked away without Pierce Atkins's signature on the contracts she carried. No, not furious, she amended. Silent. No one could use silence more effectively than Bennett Swan.<br><br>I'm not going to walk away empty-handed, she assured herself. I know how to handle temperamental entertainers. I've spent years watching how it's done and&#x2014;<br><br>Her thoughts were cut off as the door opened. Ryan stared. Staring back at her was the largest man she had ever seen. He was at least six foot five, with shoulders that all but filled the doorway. And his face. Ryan decided he was, indisputably, the ugliest human being she had ever seen. His broad face was pale. His nose had obviously been broken and had reknit at an odd angle. His eyes were small, a washed-out brown that matched his thick mat of hair. Atmosphere, Ryan thought again. Atkins must have chosen him for atmosphere.<br><br>"Good afternoon," she managed. "Ryan Swan. Mr. Atkins is expecting me."<br><br>"Miss Swan." The slow, barrel-deep voice suited him perfectly. When the man stepped back, Ryan found herself fighting a reluctance to enter. Storm clouds, a hulking butler and a brooding house on a cliff. Oh, yes, she decided. Atkins knows how to set the stage.<br><br>She walked in. As the door closed behind her, Ryan took a quick glimpse around.<br><br>"Wait here," the laconic butler instructed and walked, lightly for a big man, down the hall.<br><br>"Of course, thank you very much," she muttered to his back.<br><br>The walls were white and draped with tapestries. The one nearest her was a faded medieval scene depicting the young Arthur drawing the sword from the stone, with Merlin the Enchanter highlighted in the background. Ryan nodded. It was an exquisite piece of work and suited to a man like Atkins. Turning, she found herself staring at her own reflection in an ornate cheval glass.<br><br>It annoyed her to see that her hair was mussed. She represented Swan Productions. Ryan pushed at the stray misty blond wisps. The green of her eyes had darkened with a mixture of anxiety and excitement. Her cheeks were flushed with it. Taking a deep breath, she ordered herself to calm down. She straightened her jacket.<br><br>Hearing footsteps, she quickly turned away from the mirror. She didn't want to be caught studying herself or attempting last-minute repairs. It was the butler again, alone. Ryan repressed a surge of annoyance.<br><br>"He'll see you downstairs."<br><br>"Oh." Ryan opened her mouth to say something else, but he was already retreating. She had to scramble to keep up.<br><br>The hall wound to the right. Ryan's heels clicked quickly as she trotted to match the butler's pace. Then he stopped so abruptly, she nearly collided with his back.<br><br>"Down there." He had opened a door and was already walking away.<br><br>"But.. " Ryan scowled after him, then made her way down the dimly lighted steps. Really, this was ridiculous, she thought. A business meeting should be conducted in an office, or at least in a suitable restaurant. Show business, she mused scornfully.<br><br>The sound of her own footfalls echoed back at her. There was no sound at all from the room below. Oh, yes, she concluded, Atkins knows how to set the stage. She was beginning to dislike him intensely. Her heart was hammering uncomfortably as she rounded the last curve in the winding staircase.<br><br>The lower floor was huge, a sprawling room with crates and trunks and paraphernalia stacked all around. The walls were paneled and the floor was tiled, but no one had bothered with any further decoration. Ryan looked around, frowning, as she walked down the last of the steps.<br><br>He watched her. He had the talent for absolute stillness, absolute concentration. It was essential to his craft. He also had the ability to sum up a person quickly. That, too, was part of his profession. She was younger than he had expected, a fragile-looking woman, small in stature, slight in build, with clouds of pale hair and a delicately molded face. A strong chin.<br><br>She was annoyed, he noted, and not a little apprehensive. A smile tugged at his mouth. Even after she began to wander around the room, he made no move to go to her. Very businesslike, he thought, with her trim, tailored suit, sensible shoes, expensive briefcase and very feminine hands. Interesting.<br><br>"Miss Swan."<br><br>Ryan jolted, then swore at herself. Turning in the direction of the voice, she saw only shadows. "You're very prompt."<br><br>He moved then, and Ryan saw that he stood on a small stage. He wore black and blended with the shadows. With an effort, she kept the annoyance from her voice. "Mr. Atkins." Ryan went toward him then, fixing on a trained smile. "You have quite a house."<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>He didn't come down to her but stood on the stage. Ryan was forced to look up at him. It surprised her that he was more dramatic in person than on tape. Normally, she had found the reverse to be true. She had seen his performances. Indeed, since her father had taken ill and reluctantly turned Atkins over to her, Ryan had spent two entire evenings watching every available tape on Pierce Atkins.<br><br>Dramatic, she decided, noting a raw-boned face with a thick, waving mane of black hair. There was a small scar along his jawline, and his mouth was long and thin. His brows were arched with a slight upsweep at the tips. But it was the eyes under them which held her. She had never seen eyes so dark, so deep. Were they gray? Were they black? Yet it wasn't their color that disconcerted her, it was the absolute concentration in them. She felt her throat go dry and swallowed in defense. She could almost believe he was reading her mind.<br><br>He had been called the greatest magician of the decade, some said the greatest of the last half of the century. His illusions and escapes were daring, flashy and unexplainable. It was a common thing to hear of him referred to as a wizard. Staring into his eyes, Ryan began to understand why.<br><br>She shook herself free of the trance and started again. She didn't believe in magic. "Mr. Atkins, my father apologizes for not being able to come himself. I hope&#x2014;"<br><br>"He's feeling better."<br><br>Confused, she stopped. "Yes. Yes, he is." She found herself staring again.<br><br>Pierce smiled as he stepped down to her. "He phoned an hour ago, Miss Swan. Long-distance dialing, no telepathy." Ryan glared before she could stop herself, but his smile only widened. "Did you have a nice drive?"<br><br>"Yes, thank you."<br><br>"But a long one," he said. "Sit." Pierce gestured to a table, then took a chair behind it. Ryan sat opposite him.<br><br>"Mr. Atkins," she began, feeling more at ease now that business was about to begin. "I know my father has discussed Swan Productions' offer with you and your representative at length, but perhaps you'd like to go over the details again." She set her briefcase on the table. "I could clarify any questions you might have."<br><br>"Have you worked for Swan Productions long, Miss Swan?"<br><br>The question interrupted the flow of her presentation, but Ryan shifted her thoughts. Entertainers often had to be humored. "Five years, Mr. Atkins. I assure you, I'm qualified to answer your questions and negotiate terms if necessary."<br><br>Her voice was very smooth, but she was nervous. Pierce saw it in the careful way she folded her hands on the table. "I'm sure you're qualified, Miss Swan," he agreed. "Your father isn't an easy man to please."<br><br>Surprise and a trace of apprehension flickered into her eyes. "No," she said calmly, "which is why you can be sure of receiving the best promotion, the best production staff, the best contract available. Three one-hour television specials over three years, guaranteed prime time, with a budget that ensures quality." She paused only for a moment. "An advantageous arrangement for you and for Swan Productions."<br><br>"Perhaps."<br><br>He was looking at her too closely. Ryan forced herself not to fidget. Gray, she saw. His eyes were gray&#x2014;as dark as was possible without being black.<br><br>"Of course," she continued, "your career has been aimed primarily at live audiences in clubs and theaters. Vegas, Tahoe, the London Palladium and so forth."<br><br>"An illusion means nothing on film, Miss Swan. Film can be altered."<br><br>"Yes, I realize that. To have any impact, a trick has to be performed live."<br><br>"Illusion," Pierce corrected. "I don't do tricks."<br><br>Ryan stopped. His eyes were steady on hers. "Illusion," she amended with a nod. "The specials would be broadcasted live, with a studio audience as well. The publicity&#x2014;"<br><br>"You don't believe in magic, do you, Miss Swan?" There was the slightest of smiles on his mouth, the barest trace of amusement in his voice.<br><br>"Mr. Atkins, you're a very talented man," she said carefully. "I admire your work."<br><br>"A diplomat," he concluded, leaning back. "And a cynic. I like that."<br><br>Ryan didn't feel complimented. He was laughing at her without making the smallest attempt to conceal it. Your job, she reminded herself as her teeth clenched. Do your job. "Mr. Atkins, if we could discuss the terms of the contract&#x2014;"<br><br>"I don't do business with anyone until I know who they are."<br><br>Ryan let out a quick breath. "My father&#x2014;"<br><br>"I'm not talking to your father," Pierce interrupted smoothly.<br><br></p><h2>Salmon Fly Hooks</h2><p>The first section is on antique salmon fly hooks, over four hundred hooks pictured on thirteen plates and the second section is on contemporary hook makers, thirty eight world wide.

It turned displaced Okies like Buck Owens and Merle Haggard into household names, and in the process created a widely felt influence on style, instrumentation, and attitude in American music. <p></p> Even so, a half century after its emergence, the Bakersfield Sound's significance is underappreciated except among hardcore fans and music historians. Few recognize how this California country music not only countered a Nashville hit-seeking machine that had gone adrift but also portended a cultural shift that touched mainstream America. In this study, author Robert E. Price traces its roots from the depths of the Great Depression and World War Ii through the heyday of Owens, Haggard, and Hee Haw, and into the twenty-first century.<p></p></p><p>Robert E. Price, the award-winning editor of the Bakersfield Californian, has written and spoken extensively about the Bakersfield Sound for more than twenty years.&#x201c;This book all but reads itself.

She decides to sell her beach house on the edge of town and hires Mike Malloy, who touches her lonely heart. Can she trust a man with unbreakable ties to a community she's eager to leave behind-and who is determined to unearth her deepest secrets?</p><p>SUSAN WIGGS published her first book with Zebra in 1987, and since then she has been published by Avon, Tor, HarperCollins, Harlequin, and Mira Books, in addition to Warner. Unable to completely abandon her past profession as a teacher, Susan is a frequent workshop leader and speaker at writers' conferences, including the literary institution Fields End and the legendary Maui Writers Conference. She is the proud recipient of two RITA awards for <em>Lord of the Night</em> and <em>The Mistress</em>, and is often a finalist for the prestigious award. She lives on an island in the Pacific Northwest with her family.One February night, the car of politician Victor Winslow and his wife, Sandra, skids off an icy bridge. Afterwards, Victor is missing and presumed dead, and his wife is widely suspected of his murder despite the official conclusion that the crash was an accident. Finding that her hometown ironically named Paradise is a haven no longer, a dazed and shocked Sandra decides to renovate and sell her old beach house in order to finance a move. Mike Malloy, the contractor she hires, is an expert on historic restoration and a single dad struggling to rebuild his life after a punishing divorce. Sandra and Mike move warily toward love and healing as the house is painstakingly restored. In the process, Mike pushes Sandra toward clues that might explain Victor's fate and clear her name forever. Wiggs's characterizations are strong, particularly the portrait she paints of Mike, who is at once a fantasy romantic hero and a convincing modern man; even minor characters such as Sandra's warring parents and Mike's confused kids jump off the page with a winning blend of realism and warmth. A richly textured story that successfully moves beyond the conventions of the romance genre, this book will polish Wiggs's already glowing reputation.

Use the clues provided, including family charts, to help them solve the mystery! Even professional genealogists will enjoy this unique challenge!</p><p>Use the clues provided, including family charts, to help solve this fictional mystery by genealogist Stratton!Genealogy, genetics and keen detective work mesh effectively, if ponderously, in this first novel set on isolated Fogge Island off the New England coast. Mort Sinclair is a respected genealogist and lawyer, hired as a consultant by the state police who think his particular expertise in exploring family histories will help them solve three cyanide poisonings in the island's prominent and densely interrelated Gorges family. (Ample genealogical charts are provided to aid the reader in tracing the byzantine family connections.) When more, puzzling murders are committed, Sinclair's astute detective work with library and courthouse documents reveals nasty, long-hidden family secrets: the island's respected doctor is up to his elbows in deceitful practices; the Gorges family fortune was made unscrupulously; and, astonishingly enough, two babies were switched at birth. Sinclair works closely with Sergeant Priscilla Booth, a witty, bright and capable officer who proves to be a relentless though diplomatic interrogator. Their quietly romantic relationship lends strength and continuity to a book overly burdened with complex entanglements and labored explanations.

On his birthday, Ben is disappointed to receive a stuffed dog, as he had wished for a real one. That night Rags comes to life and takes Ben and his toy mouse, rabbit, and giraffe into the sky. Ben and Rags go to a moon overcrowded with babies and puppies. They leave the moon and stuff themselves on the ice cream planet before drifting back down ``sleepy-eyed.'' The sometimes-forced rhymes require practice to be read smoothly, but they have the same rollicking child-like humor of earlier ``Wild Baby'' favorites (all Greenwillow). The facial expressions on these cartoon characters, reminiscent of the Katzenjammer Kids, provide special appeal in these lively and humorous watercolor illustrations. One point that may concern some readers is the haziness of the line between fantasy and reality. The morning after their adventure, the other animals are stuffed toys again, but Baby Ben appears to be somewhat smugly showing his mother that Rags is a real dog on a leash, raising his leg by a tree.

Never mind that his heavy equipment are toys. His vivid imagination turns them into the real thing. The boy has much to do throughout the year, such as plowing roads and building sidewalks. But his work is a joy, because he does it to show his mother how much he loves her. This charming picture book by Jean Patrick, illustrated by Karen Dugan, introduces children to a wide range of machinery, while conveying a loving theme that makes it a perfect book for children and parents to read together.</p><p><b>Jean L.S.

She lives in Attleboro, Massachusetts.reS-Gr 1-In short vignettes, this caring and clever book tells the story of a boy's love for his mother as seen through his play with his toys. Each spread begins with "If I had a-" (truck, tractor, cement mixer, bulldozer, etc.) and tells what the boy would do for his mother. ("If I had a loader, you know what I'd do?/I'd feed the cattle, just for you-.") The art and the story line form a beautiful montage; each text box is set in an arched frame with the month of the year and an illustration of a toy at the top, accompanied by a larger illustration of the boy playing with the vehicle described. The framed picture on the facing page depicts the vision the words describe. The realistic and yet imaginary style of the art really captures the text. Each vignette is touching and shows the child interacting with the mother. His growth throughout the year and the joy and love shared between parent and child make this a special book. It is great for one-on-one reading, and offers a new twist on the ever-present need for more truck books.<p></p><p><i>JoAnn Jonas, Chula Vista Public Library, San Diego, CA</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Corsair: A Science Fiction Novel</h2><p><p>James L.

Far from a typical career retrospective, A Notebook at Random is a revelation.<br>Included here are some of Penn's signature images - austere, elegantly composed portraits, still lifes, and fashion photographs - along with rough sketches and line drawings that provide a window into ideas and images in the making. A consummate technician and innovator, Penn invites us to consider process alongside end product, providing new insight into his radical compositions, experiments with light, and unique printing techniques.<br>A Notebook at Random is populated with artists, writers, and models whose lives intersected with Penn's: Picasso, Jean Cocteau, and Lisa Fonssagrives look out at us with that timeless intensity that characterizes an Irving Penn portrait. Many of the photographs presented here are alternate poses or torn test fragments, pages from his personal "notebook"; some are newer discoveries, including a previously unpublished portrait of Truman Capote.<br>Some of the most striking pages in this "notebook" reproduce Penn's paintings, painted photographs, and mixed-media works, images so layered and exquisitely constructed that they resemble cubist assemblages. And in keeping with Penn's long-standing commitment to the optimal presentation of his work, this book is produced to the most exacting standards: fine paper, full cloth binding, and reproductions that are almost indistinguishable from his originals.</p><p>Irving Penn was born in 1917. He studied design with Alexey Brodovitch at the Philadelphia Museum School of Art and, in 1943, produced his first color photograph, a still life for the cover of Vogue. In a career of more than sixty years, he has made an extensive and influential body of work in portraiture, fashion, and still life. Mr. Penn is the author of several books, including Moments Preserved (1960), Worlds in a Small Room (1974), Flowers (1980), Passage (1991), Still Life (2000), and Earthly Bodies (2002).<br></p><h2>Trial by Fire (Newpointe 911 Series #4)</h2><p>Pastor and fireman Nick Foster found the body in the inferno engulfing his church. From the bullet wound in the head, it&#39;s clear this is no ordinary fire victim. The quiet community of Newpointe, reeling from the shock of the dead man&#39;s identity, struggles with the agonizing question: who did it---and why? Paramedic Issie Mattreaux is no icon of virtue, but she cares enough about her teenage nephew, Jake, to track him down when he turns up missing. Only, what she finds is far more than a harmless bonfire on the outskirts of town. After a chilling attempt on Issie&#39;s life, Nick takes on the role of protector even as he struggles with the tragedy that has struck his church. Whoever is behind the fire is far from finished.

It depicts man's perennial inner struggle between light and darkness, and teaches him to re-conquer his lost divinity by unveiling the "god within", the Inner Light. Overcoming the "death of God" declared by Nietzsche, The Epic of Arya speaks about the redemption of the divine and its rebirth in man. To redeem God in men: that is Arya's sacred mission.&nbsp;Half-woman, half-goddess, Arya is torn between Love and Truth, between passion and duty. Confused, she wonders: should she accept her human plight, or fulfil her divine destiny? A fundamental question ever haunts her: is Love human or divine? In that fateful question lies the future of humanity, for in each man, the divine flame slumbers, waiting to be kindled by the Light of Awakening. Rising above her fears, and breaking her idols, Arya, awakened and liberated, preaches the Eternal Religion which is above men's fleeting religions, narrow identities, and imperfect creeds, heralding a new, higher consciousness beyond the frontiers erected within man and between men.&nbsp;An inner journey of self-discovery, this inspirational, allegorical novel is the spiritual bible: it heals, awakens, transforms. Arya's epic conveys a universal message of unity, hope, and salvation in a world torn apart by the clash of civilisations and religions, offering a spiritual alternative to the two scourges plaguing mankind today: the scourge of religious fundamentalism-God idolatry-and the scourge of atheist materialism-God denial-for only a spiritual awakening can save man from his own blind folly.&nbsp;Second edition - First published by Authorhouse, USA, in 2009.&nbsp;</p><p>Thinker, author, poet, diplomat, Abir Taha is also a Doctoral Researcher in Philosophy at the Sorbonne University. Versed in philosophy and mysticism, the author espouses a spiritual worldview and believes that man's ultimate purpose and vocation in life is the fulfilment of his divine nature and destiny.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also by the author:<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<i>Fallen Suns, Rising Stars - A Novel about Second Chances&nbsp;</i>(Literary Talents, Amazon, USA, 2019).<br>- <i>Twelve Resolutions for a Happy Life - A Manual of Happiness&nbsp;</i>(Manticore Press, Australia, 2015).<br>- <i>Verses of Light</i> (Arktos, London,2014).<br>- <i>Defining Terrorism: the End of Double Standards - </i><i>Towards a universal definition of terrorism</i><i> </i>(Arktos, London, 2014).

"Am I still dreaming?" she asked her perplexed mind, overwhelmed by the boundless obscurity surrounding her, "or have I just awoken? Is not Night the time for the soul's awakening? Does not the soul blossom in the depth of the night, and dance with the stars and gods above, even as reason rules the earth and men below during the day? Am I awake, or is my awakening itself a dream?" "My eyes, wide-open, tell me that I'm conscious, but what do my eyes know of consciousness! They belong to the earth and see only the crude things of the earth, the hollow shell and the outer form; they remain blind to the subtle essence of divine truth and higher consciousness. The spirit alone, this spark of infinity, this glimpse of eternity, is blessed with divine sight, while the body totters aimlessly in the eternal darkness of blind matter. My eyes tell me that I am awake, yet my spirit looks beyond and contends that reality lies elsewhere, that what men call `the world' is but a deceptive dream, a cruel illusion of the senses, a shadow of reality." <p>As Arya thus questioned Truth, wondering about Life's manifold forms, Her hidden meaning and purpose, she again asked herself: "are we awake when our eyes are open and our reason is sovereign, or does the soul truly see when the eyes are shut and the spirit roams the ether? Does not Night unfold its deepest mysteries and reveal our inner infinity, the god within, as it unravels the secrets of the universe? But who, save a god, could answer such questions?" </p><p>"Alas! I am only a human goddess, that is, a goddess with a mission on earth. The law of Nature commands that, lest they become mere idols, all gods must go down to men, must become men, so that men can become gods. It is their divine vocation, for only by going down do they uplift life..."</p></p><h2>Boston Light: A historical perspective</h2><p>On September 14, 1716, Boston Light became the first lighthouse established in Colonial America. With many ships floundering in the treacherous waters of the Massachusetts harbor, there was a great need for navigational aid. At night and during storms, it was difficult to discern the entrance to the main shipping channel of Nantasket Roads, situated between the Brewster islands and the town of Hull. The ledges had become a graveyard for ships, resulting in great loss to human life and cargo&#x2015;a deterrent to European colonization efforts. Ship captains and merchants petitioned the colonial government for a lighthouse to be erected on Little Brewster Island as a way of safe passage to the inner harbor. Three hundred years later, Boston Light continues to serve its purpose. Today, the lighthouse is protected by an ever-present Coast Guard civilian keeper and a cadre of specially trained Coast Guard Auxiliary volunteer assistant keepers.</p><p>Prior to her appointment as the civilian keeper in 2003, Sally R. Snowman, PhD, was a learning disabilities specialist. James G. Thomson, an avid sailor, worked for the Engineering Division in the town of Plymouth, Massachusetts. He and Sally met as volunteers in the US Coast Guard Auxiliary and married at Boston Light in 1994.</p><h2>Encompassing the Globe: Portugal and the World in the 16th and 17th Centuries</h2><p>Portugal's contacts with the venerable kingdoms and empires of Africa and Asia, and later with the vast expanse of Brazil, led to unprecedented examples of cultural exchange, including the creation of strikingly beautiful and highly original works of art.<br><br><i>Encompassing the Globe</i> features more than 250 full-color reproductions of extraordinary creations that demonstrate how the Portuguese forged links among the continents and began cross-cultural dialogues. Essays by leading authorities shed light on the principal personalities of the period, the economic and religious motivations behind Portuguese expansion, and the technological advances that made the new sea routes navigable.</p><p>JAY A.

Mr. Jarvis resides in England.Book Three of the Deptford Histories, the prequel series to the Deptford Mice Triology, introduces Thomas, here a hard-drinking old sea mouse who writes down his memories to exorcise them. As a youngster, he and his friend Woodget are hoodwinked into a terrifying voyage complete with storms, battles, and a heathen god. Although this is the final book in the prequel series, it stands alone. Its archaic sentence structures and florid word choices are problematic, but series fans probably won't mind. They'll find the familiar mix of violent and heroic acts that has made the series popular. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

But suddenly a light breeze stirs the dust, a horse spooks, and Bill finds himself ferrying a broken cowpuncher in the back of his SUV, headed out to meet an ambulance.</p> <p>Moments later, Bill's day goes from bad to worse. He is summoned by undersheriff Estelle Reyes-Guzman to investigate an unattended death. Too impatient to wait for Bill, his friend George Payton decided to eat lunch on his own. A couple of bites later, he collapsed - dead of an apparent heart attack. But something isn't right.</p> <p>Then the small herd of cattle Bill had just counted is found wandering down a county highway. But there's no sign of cowpuncher Pat Gabaldon or his boss' $40,000 truck and livestock trailer. Forced into two tangled investigations, Bill faces one of the most complex cases in his 35-year career.</p></p><p>Steven F. Havill lives with his wife of more than forty years, Kathleen, in New Mexico. He is the author of more than twenty novels, taught secondary schools for 25 years, and recently earned an AAS degree in gunsmithing.Havill's Posadas County, N.Mex., mysteries feature a strong ensemble cast that for nine volumes was headed by under-sheriff Bill Gastner, then by his successor, Estelle Reyes-Guzman, for the next six. The fine 16th entry, a chronological throwback that fits between <i>Bag Limit</i> (2001) and <i>Scavengers</i> (2002), finds Gastner retired from the law and working as a livestock inspector. But Posadas is small in people, large in area, and old habits die hard. When a ranch hand goes missing, Gastner helps with the search. When Reyes-Guzman thinks something is a bit suspicious about the death of George Payton, an irascible old retired gun dealer, Gastner is quick to lend a hand and an opinion. Havill's characters have a depth and a clarity that's refined with every new book in the series. It's a pleasure to see them operate not merely as lawmen or suspects or witnesses but as members of a community where flaws and quirks are understood and accepted. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Where there are only three dozen winter residents? Where the local economy is lobstering? Period. Where your most reliable source of transportation off the island may be a small Cessna and the airstrip is dirt (or snow or mud)? Where, if the forecaster says the storm is headed safely out to sea, you know it's coming your way?</strong></p><p>Eva Murray moved to Matinicus in 1987 to teach in its one-room school. She married an island man and stayed to raise their family there. Over the years she's written a number of lively columns and articles for mainland publications. But, as she says, she doesn't do lobster wars:"If you're looking for a rabid, swashbuckling tell-all account of maritime outlaws or cut-throat lobstermen, you won't be very impressed. Yes, a rough side of this community exists, but in order to live here happily, I avoid cultivating fear. The same boys who might sprinkle roofing nails in a man's driveway, if they get mad enough, will rush to the same fellow's aid when he's in real danger, and that's the truth. Likewise, if you hope to relive an idyllic summer vacation or read an escape-to-Maine fantasy with the call of the loon and long walks on the beach, you might feel a bit short-changed. Astonishing natural beauty certainly exists on Matinicus Island, but I'm not working too hard to promote this place to visitors. The rare treat of an outer-island sunrise is a privilege for the deserving, which means for those who have endured the six months of gales or the six weeks of fog or the six days of waiting for the weather to break so the airplane can fly and they can get here. In the twenty-three years I have lived here, it's true there have been bullets. One, I think, flew right over my head a few years back. There has been vandalism, drunk driving, sabotage, theft, abuse of power, and people just acting like general-purpose jerks. Those things happen everywhere. There have also been heroic rescues, valiant searches for lost mariners, hospice care, fires fought, electricity restored, boats rescued, spontaneous celebrations and heartfelt acts of support, and graves dug by hand.

It's been yet another infuriating and boring summer with the despicable Dursleys, this time with minimal contact from our hero's non-Muggle friends from school. Harry is feeling especially edgy at the lack of news from the magic world, wondering when the freshly revived evil Lord Voldemort will strike. Returning to Hogwarts will be a relief... or will it?<p> The fifth book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series follows the darkest year yet for our young wizard, who finds himself knocked down a peg or three after the events of last year. Somehow, over the summer, gossip (usually traced back to the magic world's newspaper, the <i>Daily Prophet</i>) has turned Harry's tragic and heroic encounter with Voldemort at the Triwizard Tournament into an excuse to ridicule and discount the teen. Even Professor Dumbledore, headmaster of the school, has come under scrutiny by the Ministry of Magic, which refuses to officially acknowledge the terrifying truth that Voldemort is back. Enter a particularly loathsome new character: the toadlike and simpering ("<i>hem, hem</i>") Dolores Umbridge, senior undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, who takes over the vacant position of Defense Against Dark Arts teacher--and in no time manages to become the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, as well. Life isn't getting any easier for Harry Potter. With an overwhelming course load as the fifth years prepare for their Ordinary Wizarding Levels examinations (O.W.Ls), devastating changes in the Gryffindor Quidditch team lineup, vivid dreams about long hallways and closed doors, and increasing pain in his lightning-shaped scar, Harry's resilience is sorely tested.</p><p> <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i>, more than any of the four previous novels in the series, is a coming-of-age story. Harry faces the thorny transition into adulthood, when adult heroes are revealed to be fallible, and matters that seemed black-and-white suddenly come out in shades of gray. Gone is the wide-eyed innocent, the whiz kid of <i>Sorcerer's Stone</i>. Here we have an adolescent who's sometimes sullen, often confused (especially about girls), and always self-questioning. Confronting death again, as well as a startling prophecy, Harry ends his year at Hogwarts exhausted and pensive. Readers, on the other hand, will be energized as they enter yet again the long waiting period for the next title in the marvelous, magical series.

This is not just another textbook but a beautiful and disturbing work containing 18 case studies on the applications of modern architectural techniques in the natural landscape, including private gardens, public parks, and corporate headquarters. The descriptive essays are informative and the color photography is good, but most startling is their juxtaposition. The text accentuates the darker realities of the photographs, which show that in a natural setting modern architecture can be just as ugly and incongruous as it can be beautiful and harmonious. By bringing out this potential for a sometimes shocking ugliness, this book renders an important service. It will not teach anyone the finer points of aesthetic design, but it will make readers aware that, just as much is right with modern landscape architecture, much is also wrong with it.

Who knew about the robbery?<br>Who offered and gave the robbers help,<br>counsel and assistance?Letter of Edward I, 6 June 1303<br><br>Sir Hugh Corbett, Keeper of the Secret Seal, personal emissary of Edward I of England and a member of the King&#x2019;s Privy Council, embraced Lady Maeve, his wife, and heartily wished he was back in bed with her at Leighton Manor in Essex. He held her close, her blond hair tickling his cheek, her soft lips brushing his skin, he hugged her once more, savouring her delicate perfume, then stood back. Maeve smiled even as her lustrous blue eyes brimmed with tears, and brought up the fur-rimmed hood of her dark green cloak. Corbett thought it made her look even more beautiful, but those tears! To curb his own sadness he glanced over his shoulder at his two companions waiting on their horses. Ranulf-atte-Newgate, Principal Clerk in the Chancery of the Green Wax, red hair tied tightly behind his head, green eyes watchful in his pale face, nose slightly pinched by the cold, caught his gaze and turned away as if distracted by the clamour around the palace gate. Beside Ranulf, Chanson, Clerk of the Stables, tousle-headed and garbed in grey, was doing his best to control the sumpter pony carrying their bags and chests. Corbett glanced back at Maeve. She had now hidden her distress at her husband&#x2019;s imminent departure by bringing forward their two children, Edward and Eleanor. Corbett crouched to hug both, rose, kissed Maeve passionately on the lips, then turned, gathered the reins of his horse and swung himself up into the saddle. He pretended to busy himself with his war belt as well as adjusting the black woollen cloak about him. Then he glanced back at Maeve, mouthed a message of love and, turning his horse&#x2019;s head, led his companions out of the palace gate along the trackway to London Bridge.Corbett, like Ranulf, kept his hood pushed back to give him a better view of this crowded thoroughfare, guiding his horse prudently along its icy rutted surface. He slouched low in the saddle, blinking away the tears, staring fixedly ahead of him. Ranulf rode just behind him to his right, Chanson to his left. The Clerk of the Stables had now hoisted the lance bearing the stiffened pennant displaying the royal arms emblazoned in glorious scarlet, blue and gold, the rampant leopards proclaiming to all and sundry how these were king&#x2019;s men, not to be interfered with or impeded in any way. Even a vexillation of royal knight-bannerets pulled aside for these clerks, whom they immediately recognised and saluted. Corbett nodded courteously. Ranulf raised a hand, aware of how these royal bully-boys were studying them closely. Corbett&#x2019;s departure from Westminster certainly caused a stir. Heads turned, eyes narrowed against the bitter cold. People watched these two important clerks garbed in black leather jerkins, their dark green hose pushed into red boots of Cordova leather, one gauntleted hand grasping the reins, the other beneath their cloaks ready to draw sword or a dagger. Those who did business at Westminster recognised that the Keeper of the Secret Seal was off on the King&#x2019;s affairs. The presence of Corbett in the royal palace always provoked a sea of murmuring and whispering, speculation about what might be happening. After all, these were dangerous times. The war across the Scottish march was not progressing as well as the old king would have wished, whilst the powerful London merchants, with gangs of rifflers at their beck and call, were growing increasingly resentful at the King&#x2019;s constant demand for money to finance his struggle against Wallace in Scotland as well as to equip his war cogs patrolling the Narrow Seas against the privateers of Philip of France. Royal business, however, was secret. Corbett was the last man to discuss the reason for his departure with anyone. Instead he settled himself comfortably in his saddle, lost in his own thoughts about Maeve. Christmas and the twelve holy days had certainly passed like a dream, a heart-warming, grace-filling, soul-enriching period. Corbett had never felt so happy in his life. Once again he murmured a prayer of thanks.&#x2018;<i>Ego tibi Domine gratias et laudem</i> &#x2014; I give you thanks and praise, oh Lord.&#x2019;Oh yes, the turn of the year had proved good. Epiphany had come and gone like a watch in the night, then a royal courier had arrived at Leighton with a scroll sealed by Edward himself, a writ summoning Corbett <i>cum festinacione magna</i> &#x2014; with great haste &#x2013; down to the King&#x2019;s palace at Westminster. Corbett had ignored the great haste, insisting that Maeve and the children also join him at his lodgings in the old palace. Edward, of course, had proved to be a generous, hearty host, praising Maeve&#x2019;s beauty whilst merrily fussing the children. However, when all the courtesies were done, the King, iron-grey hair falling down to his shoulders, had grabbed Corbett&#x2019;s arm and led him out across the frost-laced palace gardens, through the south door of the great abbey and into the cloisters. Corbett sensed where they were going. The King was now silent and morose, no longer the jovial lord but muttering to himself, clawing at his silvery moustache and beard. He pushed his way through the knight-bannerets gathered round the door and started down the steep steps broken off halfway, the gap spanned by a long wooden plank, and into the cavernous circular crypt of the abbey with its eight ground-level windows and huge central pillar. Corbett detached himself from the King and put his hand in the gap, then stared around at the empty coffers, caskets and leather treasury sacks that littered the floor. Edward sat down on a coffer, glaring round, face all fierce as he muttered his favourite oaths, &#x2018;By God&#x2019;s hand&#x2019; and &#x2018;By God&#x2019;s thigh&#x2019;, followed by a litany of filthy imprecations against those who&#x2019;d dared to dig their way through one of those windows to rob the royal treasury of gold, silver, jewels and precious goods. The riflers had even removed the stones from the <i>arca</i>, the stronghold built into the centre of the massive pillar.&#x2018;They&#x2019;ll all hang, Corbett!&#x2019;&#x2018;Yes, your grace.&#x2019;&#x2018;Listen,&#x2019; the King hissed, &#x2018;how silent it is.&#x2019;Corbett walked back to the fortified door leading to the crypt steps. He was aware of the cold and the darkness, how the many candles and cresset torches flickered and flared in vain to drive back the gloom.&#x2018;Silent, your grace,&#x2019; he agreed. &#x2018;The good brothers are still lodged in the Tower?&#x2019;&#x2018;Over a hundred of the good brothers will rot there,&#x2019; the King snarled, &#x2018;until I discover the truth and get all my treasure back. You know that, Corbett!&#x2019;The Keeper of the Secret Seal certainly did. He had been party to the ruthless investigation into the great conspiracy to rob the royal treasury in the crypt of Westminster. The King&#x2019;s own hoard allegedly safe in this hallowed place, the mausoleum of his family. It should never have happened. The crypt was protected by eighteen-foot-thick walls, narrow windows, fortified doors and stairs with the steps removed halfway down to create a gap that only a specially made plank could span. Yet the outrage had still occurred. The sheer effrontery of it had shocked even the cynical officials of the Chancery and Exchequer, who dealt every day with a legion of rogues and vagabonds. The robbery had been the fruit of an unholy alliance between London&#x2019;s underworld, led by Richard Puddlicott, a former clerk, and some of the leading monks of the abbey. Puddlicott had seduced the good brothers, supposedly followers of the rule of St Benedict, by bringing into the abbey musicians, courtesans, food and wine for midnight revelry, whilst other conspirators, under the cloak of night, had weakened one window in the crypt, working secretly in the cemetery beyond to create a gap. At last they had forced an entry on the eve of St Mark and the vast treasure hoard had been taken. The leading monks had been fully aware of the conspiracy and cooperated eagerly. So much treasure had been taken that precious items had been found at Tothill, in the fields around the abbey and even fished from the Thames. The rest of the haul had abruptly appeared on the London market, the greedy goldsmiths looking the other way as they bought and sold what was clearly not theirs. Edward had been absent in Scotland, but his fury had known no bounds. He had dispatched commissioners, Corbett included, into London and the entire community of the abbey had been committed to the Tower. Courts of oyer and terminer moved through every ward of the city, names were mentioned, suspects were arrested, even dragged out of sanctuary in clear violation of ecclesiastical law. The King demanded, time and again, that the treasure be recovered whilst anyone involved in its disappearance was to be arrested and taken to the Tower.&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll grind such arrogance to dust.&#x2019; The King bit on the quick of his thumb and spat out a piece of skin. &#x2018;Corbett,&#x2019; he gestured at a nearby chair, &#x2018;sit down. I need to talk to you.&#x2019;Edward scratched the corner of his mouth as he studied this enigmatic clerk, olive-skinned, cleanly shaven, his long face hard and resolute except for the laughter lines around the firm mouth and deep-set eyes. He glimpsed the grey amongst Corbett&#x2019;s raven-black hair, now pulled back and tied in a queue to rest on the nape of his neck.&#x2018;We are getting older, Corbett,&#x2019; the King grated. He stretched out and gently tapped the clerk on the cheek, &#x2018;but you are still my soul companion, Hugh, my faithful servant.&#x2019; His words echoed round that cavernous chamber. &#x2018;I trust you as I do my own sword arm.&#x2019; Edward&#x2019;s right eye drooped, almost closing, a common gesture whenever the King&#x2019;s humours were disturbed. &#x2018;That is why I have brought you down here to talk in the silence.&#x2019;Corbett steeled himself. He respected Edward of England, a man of iron who, despite his many faults, imposed order on a chaos that, if unchecked, would sweep away Corbett&#x2019;s world of logic, reason, evidence, the rule of law and all the trappings that kept the <i>utlegati</i> &#x2014; the wolf men &#x2013; lurking beyond the light. Nevertheless, Corbett was wary of princes, and none more so than Edward, especially when he acted maudlin.&#x2018;Your grace,&#x2019; he gestured round, &#x2018;the light in here is poor, it&#x2019;s freezing cold, my wife and children ...&#x2019;&#x2018;Hugh, Hugh ...&#x2019;&#x2018;Is it this, your grace? I thought the conspiracy had been broken.&#x2019;&#x2018;This is not just my treasure hoard,&#x2019; Edward declared, beating his chest. &#x2018;It is part of me.&#x2019; He edged closer, hitching up the neck of his sack-like tunic then plucking at his coarsely woven breeches tucked into cowhide boots.Corbett hid his smile. Edward of England liked nothing better than to play the role of the peasant farmer when it suited him.&#x2018;I brought you here because something about which I must tell you belongs here. I&#x2019;ll not keep you long. I must go to the royal mews,&#x2019; Edward murmured. &#x2018;One of our beloved falcons is ill. Whilst you, Corbett, must be off to Mistleham in Essex, to question Oliver Scrope, lord of the manor.&#x2019;&#x2018;Your grace,&#x2019; Corbett protested, &#x2018;you promised me rest until well after Hilary.&#x2019;&#x2018;I know, I know.&#x2019; The King waved a hand. &#x2018;But I need you in Essex, and I&#x2019;ll tell you why.&#x2019; He breathed in deeply. &#x2018;Early last year a wandering group of Beguines, male and female, who called themselves the Free Brethren of the Holy Spirit, landed at Dover. They journeyed into Essex on to the manor lands of Lord Oliver Scrope. You&#x2019;ve heard of him?&#x2019;Corbett shrugged.&#x2018;He owns vast estates, a man certainly blessed by fortune if not by God,&#x2019; Edward added cynically. &#x2018;Oliver is an old comrade-in-arms. He and I have fought shoulder to shoulder in Wales and along the Scottish march. You do recall him?&#x2019;Corbett pulled a face, then shook his head.&#x2018;Yes you do!&#x2019; Edward teased. &#x2018;You said he had the face of a bat: balding head, with protuberant eyes, puffed cheeks and ears that stuck out.&#x2019;&#x2018;True. I remember,&#x2019; Corbett conceded. &#x2018;A small, thick-set man, hot-tempered and violent. Your grace, comrade or not, Scrope has a nasty soul, a man of blood. He took to killing like a bat to flitting. He butchered some Welsh prisoners outside Conwy, didn&#x2019;t he?&#x2019;&#x2018;Yes, yes.&#x2019; Edward grimaced. &#x2018;Oliver is a fighter. He is also a hero, Corbett, a Crusader who escaped Acre when it fell thirteen years ago to the Saracens. Fought his way through, brought back a king&#x2019;s ransom in precious goods. I converted a great deal of it into land for him and married him off to a rich heiress fifteen years his junior, Lady Hawisa Talbot. However, one thing he did not hand over to me,&#x2019; Edward narrowed his eyes, &#x2018;was the Sanguis Christi.&#x2019;&#x2018;The Blood of Christ?&#x2019;&#x2018;An exquisite cross of thick pure gold,&#x2019; the King&#x2019;s eyes gleamed, &#x2018;studded with five huge rubies allegedly containing blood from Christ&#x2019;s precious wounds. According to legend, the rubies were embedded in the True Cross found by the Empress Helena a thousand years ago. The Sanguis Christi, along with other wealth, was seized by Scrope when he fled Acre. On his return to England, he solemnly promised me, after I had given him so much help and favour, that the Sanguis Christi would be mine, either when he died or after twelve years had elapsed. It is now January 1304.&#x2019; Edward smiled. &#x2018;The twelve years have elapsed. The Sanguis Christi should be mine.&#x2019;&#x2018;Then summon him to Westminster!&#x2019; Corbett declared crossly.&#x2018;Ah, that&#x2019;s just the beginning.&#x2019; The King smiled. &#x2018;Scrope is a wily man. He was with the Templars in Acre. The Sanguis Christi and all the treasures he seized once belonged to that order. They have demanded everything back, particularly the Sanguis Christi. Scrope has utterly rejected their plea. I support him in this.&#x2019; He grinned. &#x2018;Naturally. The Temple, according to rumour, have sworn vengeance. They&#x2019;ve sent formal envoys to Lord Scrope demanding the return of their property. Scrope has refused, so the Templars, in a secret consistory, have passed sentence of death on him. Now,&#x2019; the King sighed, &#x2018;I do not know whether this is the work of the General Chapter or just extremists, but so far they have made little progress.&#x2019;&#x2018;Couldn&#x2019;t the Pope intervene?&#x2019;&#x2018;The Pope sprawls in Avignon, firmly in the power of France, who, as you know, has no great love for the Order of the Temple. Anyway, His Holiness claims that Scrope&#x2019;s treasures are the just plunders of war, whilst our archbishop, old Robert Winchelsea, when he is not in exile, fully agrees.&#x2019;&#x2018;But you are concerned that the Temple may seize the Sanguis Christi?&#x2019;&#x2018;As is Lord Scrope. He has received mysterious messages.&#x2019; Edward closed his eyes. &#x2018;&#x201c;The Mills of the Temple of God grind exceedingly slow but they do grind exceedingly small.&#x201d;&#x2019;&#x2018;How were these messages delivered?&#x2019; Corbett now forgot the freezing gloom, deeply intrigued by what the King was saying.&#x2018;Oh, writs and letters, anonymously and mysteriously delivered at Scrope&#x2019;s great manor hall.&#x2019;&#x2018;So you need me to collect the Sanguis Christi before the Temple do?&#x2019;&#x2018;Precisely!&#x2019;&#x2018;But the Temple will object to you having it.&#x2019;Edward clicked his tongue. &#x2018;They can object until the Second Coming, Corbett.

Private detective Charlie Parker is engaged by the lawyer Moxie Castin to shadow the police investigation and find the infant, but Parker is not the only searcher.

He offers good information on his particular methods of designing, finding customers, working to commissions, training help, and batching production so as to have work when business is slow. After describing his own preferred techniques of construction, gluing, veneering, and finishing, Peters gives brief instructions and plans for building a dining table and chairs, a student's desk, and six other projects. While interesting, the material on the British craft movement, vocational training, and British business-labor laws will be of little use to an American reader seeking advice on starting a cabinet-furniture shop.

He's also been in the middle of its most dangerous secrets more than once. So when he's hired to find notorious gossip "scribe" Infamia, Marcus figures the missing muckraker is either taking advantage of a vacation bribe from some wealthy wife--or resting up from injuries inflicted by some senator's henchmen.

It was then refined and honed in great secrecy through centuries of hand-to-hand combat by highly trained warriors. Its techniques were jealously guarded until late in the nineteenth century, when it was first introduced to the world by master Sokaku Takeda, who began to accept students from around the country. <br><br>It was this tradition that Morihei Ueshiba spent years studying just before he set out on his own to found Aikido-which has in recent years become one of the world's most popular martial arts. The roots of Aikido are in the Daitoryu, and for that reason Aikido practitioners will want to learn all they can about this martial art. <br><br><em>The Hidden Roots of Aikido</em> is the first book to appear in English that offers a detailed visual introduction to techniques of the Daitoryu tradition. Heavily illustrated with approximately 800 photographs, it gives a clear, complete picture of the steps involved in about 90 techniques. Its substantial section on history and theory takes a close look at the Daitoryu's historical background and philosophy, while a glossary of terms provides a handy list of the most important terms. <br><br><em>The Hidden Roots of Aikido</em> will be an indispensable learning tool for students of the Daitoryu, and a valuable reference for other martial arts practitioners.</p><p><br><strong>Shiro Omiya</strong> studied Aiki Jujutsu Daitoryu with Kozui Tsuruyama, a second-generation disciple of Sokaku Takeda, the master who first introduced the Daitoryu to the world.<br></p><h2>Salem Possessed: The Social Origins of Witchcraft</h2><p>The stark immediacy of what happened in 1692 has obscured the complex web of human passion which had been growing for more than a generation before building toward the climactic witch trials. &#34;Salem Possessed explores the lives of the men and women who helped spin that web and who in the end found themselves entagled in it.</p><p>Paul Boyer was Merle Curti Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison.Provides an admirable illustration of the general rule that, in Old and New England alike, much of the best sociological history of the twentieth century has only been made possible by the antiquarian and genealogical interests of the nineteenth... This sensitive, intelligent, and well-written book will certainly revive interest in the terrible happenings at Salem. (Keith Thomas <i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>The authors' whole approach to the Salem disaster is canny, rewarding, and sure to fascinate readers interested in that aberrant affair. (<i>The Atlantic</i>)<br><br>This is an 'inner history' of Salem Village that aims to raise the events of 1692 from melodrama to tragedy... It is a large achievement. This book is progressive history at its best, with brilliant insights, well-organized evidence, maps, and footnotes at the bottom of the page. (Cedric B. Cowing <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>This short book is a solid contribution to the understanding of the 1692 witch trials. The authors use impressively rich demographic detail to support the thesis that the witch trials are best explained as symptoms of typical social tensions in provincial towns at the time. According to Boyer and Nissenbaum, Salem villagers played roles determined by economic, geographic, and status interests. (Richard Ekman <i>Canadian Historical Review</i>)<br><br>An important, imaginative book that brings new insights to the study of the 1692 witchcraft outbreak in Massachusetts. Building on Charles Upham's <i>Salem Witchcraft</i> (1867), Boyer and Nissenbaum explore decades of community tension and conflict in order to explain why Salem was the focus of this episode. The authors reveal a complex set of relationships between persons allied with the growing mercantile interests of Salem Town and those linked to the subsistence-based economy of outlying Salem Village. (Carol Karlsen <i>Journal of Women in Culture and Society</i>)<br><br>A provocative book. Drawing upon an impressive range of unpublished local sources, Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum provide a challenging new interpretation of the outbreak of witchcraft in Salem Village. They argue that previous historians erroneously divorced the tragic events of 1692 from the long-term development of the village and therefore failed to realize that the witch trials were simply one particularly violent chapter in a series of local controversies dating back to the 1660s. In their reconstruction of the socio-economic conditions that contributed to the intense factionalism in Salem Village, Boyer and Nissenbaum have made a major contribution to the social history of colonial New England... [They] have provided us with a first-rate discussion of factionalism in a seventeenth-century New England community. Their handling of economic, familial, and spatial relationships within Salem Village is both sophisticated and imaginative. (T. H.

Despite assurances to Longstreet from prominent Confederates, President Davis does not remove Bragg to make way for Longstreet.

"My own desire in the matter is to save the country" he had written to a fervent supporter in the Confederate Congress. "I hope that I may get west in time to save what there is left of us."

Since the 1970s-when this book was first published-countless numbers have flocked to the countryside in search of self-sufficiency and refuge from cities and suburbs. This is the book that guided them. And now, 50 years later, it is finally back in print for a new generation of aspiring homesteaders.</p> <p>Written in simple, direct language, <i>The Owner-Built Homestead </i>contains volumes of information about various aspects of settling and farming the land, including vegetable gardening, raising animals, maintaining a fish pond, harvesting trees, and building a green house.

In addition to agrarians and full-time homesteaders, it will appeal to backyard gardeners, weekend country folk, and city-bound ecologists alike. </p> <p>The book begins with a discussion of the mindset and attitudes essential to successful homesteading, followed by 20 fully-illustrated chapters of advice and instruction for sensible farming practices. Subjects include selecting and laying out a homestead site, with instructions for building roads, fences, a shop and a pit greenhouse; developing and managing water and soil resources; planting crops; tree and woodland production; animal and fish care; sanitation; and important information about nutrition. </p> <p>Ken and Barbara Kern were firm believers in the enduring value of the homestead life.

He has watched his son grow and struggle. David has taught him more than he can ever talk about or write in a book about what it means to follow Jesus. This book is his attempt to capture a small piece of that. John has a BA from Wake Forest University, and an MDiv from Fuller Seminary. He has been on Young Life staff for 33 years, and is currently located in New York City with his beautiful wife Gae and their three kids, Michael (24), Jessi (22) and David (17).

John&#39;s desire for David to experience God&#39;s love has motivated him to take huge risks, to advocate hard for kids that were being overlooked, and to dive deep into God&#39;s love himself. As with most things with God, the journey has been different than expected; the lows have been very low, but the highs have been amazingly miraculous.

We will always be happy, he argued, if we learn to desire that things should be exactly as they are. After attaining his freedom, Epictetus spent his entire career teaching philosophy and advising a daily regimen of self-examination. His pupil Arrianus later collected and published the master's lecture notes; the <em>Enchiridion, </em><em>or Manual</em>.&nbsp; It is a distillation of Epictetus' teachings and an instructional manual for a tranquil life.

Napoleon famously declared that an army marched on its stomach; less familiar is the idea that great authors were as eager to feed their stomachs as their imaginations. Far-ranging in both time and place, this exploration of literary eating and great writing about food will amuse, surprise, and make the mouth water. The anthology begins with examples of hospitality, ranging from Chaucer's convivial Franklin to Walter Scott's bountiful breakfasts and dinner with Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Ramsay. Next comes eating to impress&#x2014;dazzling banquets from Flaubert to F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x2014;and some great fictional love feasts (there is no doubt that in literature food and love go together rather better than love and marriage). Many of our most vivid memories of food in literature were laid down in childhood, and nostalgia is to the fore in such classic scenes as Pinocchio aching with hunger, Ratty and Mole picnicking, enchanted Turkish delight in Narnia, and a seaside picnic from Enid Blyton. A section on distant times and places ranges from seethed tortoise in ancient China to seal&#x2019;s liver fried in penguin blubber as a treat for Captain Scott. Those who relish simplicity rather than excess will enjoy Sydney Smith&#x2019;s delicate salad dressing and Hemingway&#x2019;s appreciation of oysters.</p><p><b>Christina Hardyment</b> is the author of more than 10 books on literature and social history, including <i>Writing Britain: Wastelands to Wonderlands </i>and <i>The World of Arthur Ransome</i>.

Based on primary source material from the Watuga County, North Carolina archives, <i>Rebels in Blue</i> provides a fast-paced, gripping narrative of uncommon love and blind revenge set against the turmoil of the Civil War.</p><p>Mountaineers and avowed Unionists from western North Carolina, the Blalocks were married on the eve of the Civil War and hoped to avoid the coming trouble. Keith was nevertheless coerced into joining the Confederate army, and Malinda disguised herself and went along; both entered the 26th North Carolina regiment. In March 1862, Malinda was wounded in a skirmish, unmasked and quickly discharged, whereupon her husband deliberately rolled in some poison oak, feigned "swamp fever" and was allowed to join her. Veteran features journalist Stevens (The Mayflower Murderer) tracks the Blalocks back to their mountain, where they apprehensively looked on as Southern conscription officers combed the region for "cannon fodder." As local men joined both sides, Keith's family pressured him to reenlist. Deserters and Unionists took to hiding in the hills, and when a rebel group came to grab Keith, the Blalocks joined the outlaws, sniping at rebel soldiers, raiding their enemies' farms and houses and generally raising a ruckus. Keith eventually joined the 10th Michigan Cavalry, and both Blalocks led daring raids and scouting missions into North Carolina. While Stevens has not focused on the emotional vicissitudes or gender-identity implications of the Blalock marriage, he has mined a wealth of sources, including interviews with descendants, to construct a carefully detailed and often absorbing account of how the Civil War affected an often forgotten region. He continues the Blalocks' tale into the postwar years, highlighting Keith's struggle to keep his monthly pension from the government for his wartime service. 8 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by PW.

Conversational in tone, but capable of addressing the political and semiotic methods adopted by the academy, Krystal's clear and allusive style constituted a reprimand to the fashionable idea that literature is the theorists' domain. His new book, The Half-Life of an American Essayist, continues to demonstrate that the literary essay in the right hands can itself be a subset of literature. Whether he's examining the evolution of the typewriter, the nature of sin, the cultural implications of physiognomy, the works of Paul Valery and Raymond Chandler, or his own ineffable laziness, Krystal's buoyant prose always speaks to the common reader.<br><br>The twelve essays in The Half-Life - the title is from Goethe's "Experience is only half of experience" - go deeper than the standard book piece; they hew to the line first drawn by Montaigne and later extended by Dr. Johnson, Hazlitt, Woolf and Orwell. Although there may be no preordained way of writing about literature, Krystal takes his cue from Edwin Denby, who maintained that the first duty of the critic is to be "interesting." No matter how large the subject - whether it is the history of boxing or the growth of the Holocaust industry, Krystal paints broad subjects with precise brushstrokes. Erudite, lettristic, and informative, his essays are still accessible to the general reader. The reason is simple: as Dr. Johnson noted, "What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure." To this one might add that there is satisfaction to be had in the effort itself. How else could one write as committedly and entertainingly about Paul Valery's Cahiers as about Joe Louis's left jab?</p><p>Arthur Krystal is a full-time essayist, part-time editor, and sometime screenwriter. He has edited Jacques Barzun's The Culture We Deserve and A Company of Readers, a selection of essays written by Barzun, W.H. Auden, and Lionel Trilling for The Readers' Subscription and Mid-Century Book Clubs. Krystal's own reviews and essays have appeared in The American Scholar, Harper's, The New Yorker, The New York Times Book Review, The Wall Street Journal, The Village Voice, The Washington Post Book World, The Times Literary Supplement, Sports Illustrated, and Arts &amp; Antiques.Cantankerous freelancer Krystal (Agitations: Essays on Life and Literature) here offers his second collection of literary essays, including pieces previously published in The American Scholar, Harper's Magazine, and The New Yorker. The book's title is a riff on Goethe's phrase, "Experience is only half of experience." As Krystal notes in the opening, he's not one for churning out commercially viable personal essays, or as he bluntly puts it, "creative non-fiction nonsense." Instead, we are treated to a well-crafted set of eclectic essays covering subjects ranging from the history of the typewriter, to ex-slave turned pugilist Tom Molineaux, to the Mid-Century Book Society. As with his previous work, his latest output derives its strength from Krystal's dry wit and his seeming inability to pull any punches. Consider the way, for example, in an essay on Raymond Chandler, he dispatches Kingsley Amis's praise for Mickey Spillane's skill at moving his plots forward: "Arrant nonsense. Bad writing by itself is sufficient to stop the action and Spillane is 95 percent bad writing." Whether you agree with him or not, this is refreshingly good stuff. Recommended for all libraries. --William D. Walsh, Library Journal<br><br>Krystal makes a vigorous case for the virtues of old-fashioned literary criticism, twitting the navel gazers of creative nonfiction, which he dismisses as just a fancy word for memoir: Writing interestingly about Jane Austen requires more imagination than confessing to having slept with someone named Jane Austen from Beaumont, Texas. Krystal ranges widely, taking on subjects ranging from the typewriter to boxing, and he s not afraid of weighty topics: he slogs through the notebooks of Paul Valï¿½ry, ponders different theories of beauty and offers a defense of the seven deadly sins. ( On the whole, he writes, it helps to have sin around; it s like having a set of instructions for building a life that God approves of. ) In My Holocaust Problem, Krystal (whose grandparents died in the camps) complains that the profusion of Holocaust books, films and memorials the pomp and circumstance of remembrance has trivialized the event. If the argument isn t terribly original, he subtly ponders the obligations of remembrance. In his charming concluding essay, Who Speaks for the Lazy?, Krystal returns to justifying his underachieving ways: Let s face it, some boys and girls become writers because the only workplace they re willing to visit is the one inside their heads. --Matthew Price, <i>New York Times Book Review<i></i></i></p><h2>The Alfie Treasury</h2><p>The adventures begin when Alfie locks his mum out of the house, racing to get home first!

His work appeared indefatigably in <i>The Nation, The New Republic, The London Observer, The New York Times, Harper's, Esquire, New York Magazine</i>, and more. <i>The Collected Works of Harold Clurman</i> captures over six hundred of Clurman's encounters with the most significant events in American theatre &#x2013; as well as his regular passionate embraces of dance, music, art and film. This chronological epic offers the most comprehensive view of American theatre seen through the eyes of our most extraordinary critic. 1102 pages, hardcover.</p><p>Cofounder of the Group Theatre and director of such notable plays as Clifford Odets's Awake and Sing! and Carson McCullers's Member of the Wedding , Clurman (1901-1980) also reviewed other people's theatrical endeavors, primarily for the Nation and the New Republic . Virtually every article in this comprehensive collection exudes the wide-ranging curiosity and deep knowledge of all the arts and their history that led many to regard Clurman as the finest drama critic of his day. (The book also contains a smattering of material on painting, music, film and ballet.) It's unfortunate that such fine work is ill-served by the editors of this collection. TV writer/producer Loggia and Applause Books publisher Young provide no biographical information and hardly any annotation to clarify references and sources; as a result, Clurman's astute commentary floats in a historical vacuum that would have appalled its author, who firmly believed that all art has a social context. The editors also do Clurman a disservice by their lack of selectivity: his cogent analysis of the commercial theater's shortcomings loses its force by being repeated virtually unchanged in several essays, and the appendices (which clumsily violate the book's chronological structure) could have been eliminated altogether. Still, those who care about theater and criticism will savor Clurman's passionate, pointed prose. <p></p><p>Copyright 1994 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Fremde Nï¿½he: Celan als ï¿½bersetzer : eine Ausstellung des Deutschen Literaturarchivs in Verbindung mit dem Prï¿½sidialdepartement der Stadt Zï¿½rich im ... und im Stadthaus Zï¿½rich (German Edition)</h2><p>Hard to Find book</p><p>Text: German</p><h2>Art-glass Handbook</h2><p>Handbook of 150 types of art glass with 2,000 prices for all kinds, shapes, sizes and colors.</p><p></p><h2>Phallic Frenzy: Ken Russell and His Films</h2><p><p>Ken Russell has made some of the most daring, disturbing, and beautifully photographed films of all time.

After discovering at a very young age that she possessed certain psychic gifts and the ability to make contact with spirits of the dead, she developed an intense interest in the world of the occult. In the summer of 1969 she was formally introduced to witchcraft and spiritualism by an older family member, and has since devoted her personal life and writing career to educating the public about the ways of the Craft.<br>As a teenager, Gerina Dunwich (using a different nom de plume at the time) began writing poetry, short stories, magazine articles, and stage plays complete with musical scores. Her first published newspaper article,&nbsp;<i>His Voice was His Vehicle,</i>&nbsp;was an interview with singer/songwriter Jim Peterik from the rock n&#x2019; roll group, the Ides of March (and later, Survivor). Co-written with her cousin, Barbara Williams, it was published in October 1976.<br>By the spring of 1980 Gerina Dunwich was publishing a small press literary journal called&nbsp;<i>Golden Isis,</i>&nbsp;a one-woman operation that specialized in Goddess-inspired poetry and offbeat fiction. Its international circulation grew to nearly 3600 and it attracted subscribers from places as far away as Puerto Rico, Australia, Italy, and Japan.&nbsp;<i>Circle of Shadows</i>&nbsp;- a collection of Gerina&#x2019;s own poetry, was self-published a decade later.<br>After visiting Salem, Massachusetts, in April of 1984, Gerina relocated to the North Shore of Boston, residing first in Beverly, and then in Ipswich. In the winter of 1986, she purchased the historic Moses Day Homestead - a stately 17th century Colonial house in Haverhill that had been built around the time of the infamous Salem witchcraft trials. The house, which had been featured in a local television documentary about haunted houses in the Boston area, was a hotbed of paranormal activity. Soon after moving there, Gerina experienced a vivid dream in which the spirit of the late witchcraft author Sybil Leek appeared and whispered to her that her destiny as an author was "written in the stars." The dream proved to be prophetic when, in 1987, Gerina landed her first book contract with Citadel Press. (Appropriately, the contract was dated October 31st.) The following year saw the publication of her first book,&nbsp;<i>Candlelight Spells,</i>&nbsp;and the start of her successful career as a prolific book author.<br>In December of 1993 she moved into a century-old Victorian mansion located in the quaint and historic town of Fort Covington, New York. She soon opened a small shop on High Street called "The Country Witch" (later renamed "The Calico Cat Whatnot Shop"), which sold antiques, curios and various occult supplies. (Coincidentally, the antique shop run by Sybil Leek in the New Forest was also located on a High Street.) The business proved to be instrumental in bringing together many of the area's Pagans, including several who would later become Gerina's close friends and members of her coven.<br>In February of 1998 Gerina Dunwich received a ministerial license from the Universal Life Church. Ironically, the first handfasting she performed as a legally ordained minister was for the younger brother of the cousin who had introduced her to witchcraft nearly thirty years earlier.<br>Gerina has been a guest on numerous radio talk shows throughout the United States and Canada. She has lectured and presented workshops at festivals and gatherings across the country, including the CraftWise Pagan Gathering (Waterbury, Connecticut), the Real Witches' Ball (Columbus, Ohio), and Panpipes' Pagan Day Festival (West Hollywood, California).<br>She is a member of the International Ghost Hunters Society, the Author&#x2019;s Guild, and the Fellowship of Isis. Her biography is listed in a number of reference works, such as&nbsp;<i>Who's Who in the East; Who&#x2019;s Who of American Women, Personalities of America;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Crossroads: Who's Who of the Magickal Community</i>&nbsp;(published by The Witching Well Education and Research Center, 1988). She is also mentioned in Anne Carson's&nbsp;<i>Goddesses and Wise Women,</i>&nbsp;Raymond Buckland&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Witch Book,</i>&nbsp;and other works.<br>In addition to being an occult author and respected spokesperson for the Neo-Pagan community, Gerina Dunwich is a freelance paranormal researcher who specializes in ghost animals and animal-related hauntings. In 2005 she founded the Paranormal Animal Research Group, which investigates haunted places and researches animal sensitivity to paranormal anomalies.</p><h2>Memoirs of the rival houses of York and Lancaster, historical and biographical: embracing a period of English history from the accession of Richard II. to the death of Henry VII</h2><p>Vol-1, Pages 570 It is the reproduction of the old book published long back.

Playful words, arch smiles, and a touch of coquetry had seemed natural to Nell; but now her grave tone and her almost wistful glance disconcerted Joe.</p> <p>During all the long journey over the mountains she had been cheerful and bright, while now, when they were about to part, perhaps never to meet again, she showed him the deeper and more earnest side of her character. It checked his boldness as nothing else had done. Suddenly there came to him the real meaning of a woman&#x2019;s love when she bestows it without reservation. Silenced by the thought that he had not understood her at all, and the knowledge that he had been half in sport, he gazed out over the wild country before them.</p> <p>The scene impressed its quietness upon the young couple and brought more forcibly to their minds the fact that they were at the gateway of the unknown West; that somewhere beyond this rude frontier settlement, out there in those unbroken forests stretching dark and silent before them, was to be their future home.</p> <p>From the high bank where they stood the land sloped and narrowed gradually until it ended in a sharp point which marked the last bit of land between the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. Here these swift streams merged and formed the broad Ohio. The newborn river, even here at its beginning proud and swelling as if already certain of its faraway grandeur, swept majestically round a wide curve and apparently lost itself in the forest foliage.</p> <p>On the narrow point of land commanding a view of the rivers stood a long, low structure enclosed by a stockade fence, on the four corners of which were little box-shaped houses that bulged out as if trying to see what was going on beneath. The massive timbers used in the construction of this fort, the square, compact form, and the small, dark holes cut into the walls, gave the structure a threatening, impregnable aspect.</p> <p>Below Nell and Joe, on the bank, were many log cabins. The yellow clay which filled the chinks between the logs gave these a peculiar striped appearance. There was life and bustle in the vicinity of these dwellings, in sharp contrast with the still grandeur of the neighboring forests. There were canvas-covered wagons around which curly-headed youngsters were playing. Several horses were grazing on the short grass, and six red and white oxen munched at the hay that had been thrown to them. The smoke of many fires curled upward, and near the blaze hovered ruddy-faced women who stirred the contents of steaming kettles. One man swung an axe with a vigorous sweep and the clean, sharp strokes rang on the air; another hammered stakes into the ground on which to hang a kettle. Before a large cabin a fur trader was exhibiting his wares to three Indians. A second redskin was carrying a pack of pelts from a canoe drawn up on the riverbank. A small group of persons stood near; some were indifferent, and others gazed curiously at the savages. Two children peeped from behind their mother&#x2019;s skirts as if half-curious, half-frightened.</p> <p>From this scene, the significance of which had just dawned on him, Joe turned his eyes again to his companion. It was a sweet face he saw; one that was sedate, but had a promise of innumerable smiles. The blue eyes could not long hide flashes of merriment. The girl turned, and the two young people looked at each other. Her eyes softened with a woman&#x2019;s gentleness as they rested upon him, for, broad of shoulder, and lithe and strong as a deer stalker, he was good to look at.</p> <p>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We have known each other only three weeks. Since you joined our wagon train, and have been so kind to me and so helpful to make that long, rough ride endurable, you have won my regard. I&#x2014;I cannot say more, even if I would. You told me you ran away from your Virginian home to seek adventure on the frontier, and that you knew no one in all this wild country. You even said you could not, or would not, work at farming. Perhaps my sister and I are as unfitted as you for this life; but we must cling to our uncle because he is the only relative we have. He has come out to join the Moravians, and to preach the gospel to these Indians. We shall share his life, and help him all we can. You have been telling me you&#x2014;you cared for me, and now that we are about to part I&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know what to say to you&#x2014;unless it is: Give up this intention of yours to seek adventure, and come with us. It seems to me you need not hunt for excitement here; it will come unsought.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I wish I were Jim,&#x201d; said he, suddenly.</p> <p>&#x201c;Who is Jim?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;My brother.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Tell me of him.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing much to tell. He and I are all that are left of our people, as you and Kate of yours. Jim&#x2019;s a preacher, and the best fellow&#x2014;oh! I cared a lot for Jim.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Then why did you leave him?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I was tired of Williamsburg&#x2014;I quarreled with a fellow, and hurt him. Besides, I wanted to see the West; I&#x2019;d like to hunt deer and bear and fight Indians. Oh, I&#x2019;m not much good.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Was Jim the only one you cared for?&#x201d; asked Nell, smiling. She was surprised to find him grave.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, except my horse and dog, and I had to leave them behind,&#x201d; answered Joe, bowing his head a little.</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d like to be Jim because he&#x2019;s a preacher, and could help Uncle convert the Indians?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, partly that, but mostly because&#x2014;somehow&#x2014;something different you&#x2019;ve said or done has made me care for you in a different way, and I&#x2019;d like to be worthy of you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I can believe it, when you say you are &#x2018;no good,&#x2019;&#x201d; she replied.</p> <p>&#x201c;Nell,&#x201d; he cried, and suddenly grasped her hand.</p> <p>She wrenched herself free, and leaped away from him. Her face was bright now, and the promise of smiles was made good.</p> <p>&#x201c;Behave yourself, sir.&#x201d; She tossed her head with a familiar backward motion to throw the chestnut hair from her face, and looked at him with eyes veiled slightly under their lashes. &#x201c;You will go with Kate and me?&#x201d;</p> <p>Before he could answer, a cry from someone on the plain below attracted their attention. They turned and saw another wagon train pulling into the settlement. The children were shouting and running alongside the weary oxen; men and women went forward expectantly.</p> <p>&#x201c;That must be the train Uncle expected. Let us go down,&#x201d; said Nell.</p> <p>Joe did not answer; but followed her down the path. When they gained a clump of willows near the cabins he bent forward and took her hand. She saw the reckless gleam in his eyes.</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t. They&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; she whispered.</p> <p>&#x201c;If that&#x2019;s the only reason you have, I reckon I don&#x2019;t care,&#x201d; said Joe.</p> <p>&#x201c;What do you mean? I didn&#x2019;t say&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t tell&#x2014;oh! let me go!&#x201d; implored Nell.</p> <p>She tried to release the hand Joe had grasped in his broad palm, but in vain; the more she struggled the firmer was his hold. A frown wrinkled her brow and her eyes sparkled with spirit. She saw the fur trader&#x2019;s wife looking out of the window, and remembered laughing and telling the good woman she did not like this young man; it was, perhaps, because she feared those sharp eyes that she resented his audacity. She opened her mouth to rebuke him; but no words came. Joe had bent his head and softly closed her lips with his own.</p> <p>For a single instant during which Nell stood transfixed, as if with surprise, and looking up at Joe, she was dumb. Usually the girl was ready with sharp or saucy words and impulsive in her movements; but now the bewilderment of being kissed, particularly within view of the trader&#x2019;s wife, confused her. Then she heard voices, and as Joe turned away with a smile on his face, the unusual warmth in her heart was followed by an angry throbbing.</p> <p>Joe&#x2019;s tall figure stood out distinctly as he leisurely strolled toward the incoming wagon train without looking backward. Flashing after him a glance that boded wordy trouble in the future, she ran into the cabin.</p> <p>As she entered the door it seemed certain the grizzled frontiersman sitting on the bench outside had grinned knowingly at her, and winked as if to say he would keep her secret. Mrs. Wentz, the fur trader&#x2019;s wife, was seated by the open window which faced the fort; she was a large woman, strong of feature, and with that calm placidity of expression common to people who have lived long in sparsely populated districts. Nell glanced furtively at her and thought she detected the shadow of a smile in the gray eyes.</p> <p>&#x201c;I saw you and your sweetheart kissing behind the willow,&#x201d; Mrs. Wentz said in a matter-of-fact voice. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see why you need hide to do it. We folks out here like to see the young people sparkin&#x2019;. Your young man is a fine-appearin&#x2019; chap. I felt certain you was sweethearts, for all you allowed you&#x2019;d known him only a few days. Lize Davis said she saw he was sweet on you. I like his face. Jake, my man, says as how he&#x2019;ll make a good husband for you, and he&#x2019;ll take to the frontier like a duck does to water. I&#x2019;m sorry you&#x2019;ll not tarry here awhile. We don&#x2019;t see many lasses, especially any as pretty as you, and you&#x2019;ll find it more quiet and lonesome the farther West you get. Jake knows all about Fort Henry, and Jeff Lynn, the hunter outside, he knows Eb and Jack Zane, and Wetzel, and all those Fort Henry men. You&#x2019;ll be gettin&#x2019; married out there, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You are&#x2014;quite wrong,&#x201d; said Nell, who all the while Mrs. Wentz was speaking grew rosier and rosier. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not anything&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>Then Nell hesitated and finally ceased speaking. She saw that denials or explanations were futile; the simple woman had seen the kiss, and formed her own conclusions. During the few days Nell had spent at Fort Pitt she had come to understand that the dwellers on the frontier took everything as a matter of course. She had seen them manifest a certain pleasure; but neither surprise, concern, nor any of the quick impulses so common among other people. And this was another lesson Nell took to heart. She realized that she was entering upon a life absolutely different from her former one, and the thought caused her to shrink from the ordeal. Yet all the suggestions regarding her future home; the stories told about Indians, renegades, and of the wild border life, fascinated her. These people who had settled in this wild region were simple, honest, and brave; they accepted what came as facts not to be questioned, and believed what looked true. Evidently the fur trader&#x2019;s wife and her female neighbors had settled in their minds the relation in which the girl stood to Joe.</p> <p>This latter reflection heightened Nell&#x2019;s resentment toward her lover. She stood with her face turned away from Mrs. Wentz; the little frown deepened, and she nervously tapped her foot on the floor.</p> <p>&#x201c;Where is my sister?&#x201d; she presently asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;She went to see the wagon train come in. Everybody&#x2019;s out there.&#x201d;</p> <p>Nell deliberated a moment and then went into the open air. She saw a number of canvas-covered wagons drawn up in front of the cabins; the vehicles were dusty and the wheels encrusted with yellow mud. The grizzled frontiersman who had smiled at Nell stood leaning on his gun, talking to three men, whose travel-stained and worn homespun clothes suggested a long and toilsome journey. There was the bustle of excitement incident to the arrival of strangers; to the quick exchange of greetings, the unloading of wagons, and unharnessing of horses and oxen.</p> <p>Nell looked here and there for her sister. Finally she saw her standing near her uncle while he conversed with one of the teamsters. The girl did not approach them; but glanced quickly around in search of someone else. At length she saw Joe unloading goods from one of the wagons; his back was turned toward her, but she at once recognized the challenge conveyed by the broad shoulders. She saw no other person; gave heed to nothing save what was to her, righteous indignation.</p> <p>Hearing her footsteps, the young man turned, and, glancing at her admiringly, said:</p> <p>&#x201c;Good evening, miss.&#x201d;</p> <p>Nell had not expected such a matter-of-fact greeting from Joe. There was not the slightest trace of repentance in his calm face, and he placidly continued his labor.</p> <p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you sorry you&#x2014;you treated me so?&#x201d; burst out Nell.</p> <p>His coolness was exasperating. Instead of contrition and apology that she had expected, and which was her due, he evidently intended to tease her, as he had done so often.</p> <p>The young man dropped a blanket and stared.</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; he said gravely. &#x201c;I never saw you before.&#x201d;</p> <p>This was too much for quick-tempered Nell. She had had some vague idea of forgiving him, after he had sued sufficiently for pardon; but now, forgetting her good intentions in the belief that he was making sport of her when he should have pleaded for forgiveness, she swiftly raised her hand and slapped him smartly.</p> <p>The red blood flamed to the young man&#x2019;s face; as he staggered backward with his hand to his cheek, she heard a smothered exclamation behind her, and then the quick joyous barking of a dog.</p> <p>When Nell turned she was amazed to see Joe standing beside the wagon, while a big white dog was leaping upon him. Suddenly she felt faint. Bewildered, she looked from Joe to the man she had just struck; but could not say which was the man who professed to love her.</p> <p>&#x201c;Jim! So you followed me!&#x201d; cried Joe, starting forward and flinging his arms around the other.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, Joe, and right glad I am to find you,&#x201d; answered the young man, while a peculiar expression of pleasure came over his face.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to see you again! And here&#x2019;s my old dog Mose! But how on earth did you know? Where did you strike my trail? What are you going to do out here on the frontier? Tell me all. What happened after I left&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>Then Joe saw Nell standing nearby, pale and distressed, and he felt something was amiss. He glanced quickly from her to his brother; she seemed to be dazed, and Jim looked grave.</p> <p>&#x201c;Nell, this is my brother Jim, the one I told you about. Jim, this is my friend, Miss Wells.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I am happy to meet Miss Wells,&#x201d; said Jim, with a smile, &#x201c;even though she did slap my face for nothing.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Slapped you? What for?&#x201d; Then the truth dawned on Joe, and he laughed until the tears came into his eyes. &#x201c;She took you for me! Ha, ha, ha!

But in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, a number of American artists, writers, and educational philosophers cast imitation and emulation as central to the linked projects of imagining the self and consolidating the nation. Tracing continuities between literature, material culture, and pedagogical theory, William Huntting Howell uncovers an America that celebrated the virtues of humility, contingency, and connection to a complex whole over ambition and distinction.</p><p><i>Against Self-Reliance</i> revalues and rethinks what it meant to be repetitive, derivative or pointedly generic in the early republic and beyond. Howell draws on such varied sources as Benjamin Franklin's programs for moral reform, Phillis Wheatley's devotional poetry, David Rittenhouse's coins and astronomical machines, Benjamin Rush's psychological and political theory, Susanna Rowson's schoolbooks, and the novels of Charles Brockden Brown and Herman Melville to tease out patterns of dependence in early America. With its incisive critique of America's storied heroic individualism, <i>Against Self-Reliance</i> argues that the arts of dependence were&#x2014;and are&#x2014;critical to the project of American independence.</p></p><p>William Huntting Howell teaches English at Boston University.<p>Introduction<br>Imitation Is Suicide</p><p>In the summer of 2007, a piece of graffiti appeared on the wall of a bathroom in the Earwax Cafï¿½, near the intersection of Milwaukee and Damen Avenues on Chicago's northwest side.</p><p>With the broad strokes of a blue paint marker, an artist identifying him- or herself as "Stel/Sim" had written "Imitation is Suicide." Though not the most common graffiti&#x2014;I didn't see any other iterations around the neighborhood that day, and I haven't seen any since&#x2014;it nevertheless distills one of the organizing principles of contemporary U.S. culture: imitation is an existential threat.</p><p>A 2008 essay in <i>Psychology Today</i>&#x2014;one of the great barometers of American conventional wisdom&#x2014;frames the problem rather starkly: "A hunger for authenticity guides us in every age and aspect of life. It drives our explorations of work, relationships, play, and prayer. Teens and twentysomethings try out friends, fashions, hobbies, jobs, lovers, locations, and living arrangements to see what fits and what's 'just not me.' Midlifers deepen commitments to career, community, faith, and family that match their self-images, or feel trapped in existences that seem not their own. Elders regard life choices with regret or satisfaction based largely on whether they were 'true' to themselves."</p><p>As <i>Psychology Today</i> imagines it, the injunction to "be yourself" properly structures the entirety of the American life cycle: from adolescence to senescence, living well means finding and amplifying the still, small voice of individualism; to model oneself on another ("what's 'just not me'") is to be inauthentic or false to one's "true" essence and to set oneself up for a lifetime of "regret." We might be skeptical about <i>Psychology Today</i>'s blithe generalizations about generational difference, its reduction of existence to "friends, fashions, hobbies, jobs, lovers, locations, and living arrangements," and its deployment of a universalizing "us," but the principle of antiimitation and antidependence that it describes nevertheless saturates contemporary culture. Indeed, resistance to imitation operates over and above other deeply felt cultural fissures: "Never Follow" is both a song by the anti-capitalist punk band Naked Raygun and an advertising slogan for Audi of America.</p><p>Of course, there is more in Stel/Sim's graffiti than an evocation of American pop psychology. For one thing, in the context of guerilla public expression, the image presents an aesthetic manifesto: to be legitimate (and psychologically legitimating), the work of art must be original to its maker. That is, the art-object must be unique, exceptional in the sense that it breaks from what has come before, and recognizable as something new. Borrowing and repurposing is fine, so long as the source is somehow transformed by the appropriating artist: hip-hop DJs lift from old songs to make new beats, and therefore they are making art; Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes and Roy Lichtenstein's cartoon paintings rely on familiar iconography, but they count as art because their obvious derivativeness operates as original commentary on the bright vacancy of consumer and popular culture. Multiples and editions&#x2014;as with someone like Jeff Koons&#x2014;are fine, but <i>copies</i> of someone else's objects are imagined to be flat, pale, weak&#x2014;bereft of the spark of life, dead on arrival. This is as true for the graffiti writer as it is for the piece he or she makes: dependence on the work of another compromises the creative self. The work of art that borrows the style or idiom of another is the material sign of an immature voice, a lack of imagination, a misunderstanding of cultural conventions, or bad faith. (In the language of the graffiti world, such imitation is known as "biting"&#x2014;as if the copyist were a kind of parasite.) To knowingly imitate in spite of such proscriptions is to voluntarily cede membership in the community&#x2014;to commit social suicide. She who would make a name for herself cannot do so in borrowed finery.</p><p>Art and artistic subjectivity are not the only things at stake here, though. To the cafï¿½-going public, Stel/Sim's message simply suggests that <i>any</i> copying activity is suspect and that <i>all</i> subjectivity must be an organic and sui generis expression of the psychological interior. What marks an individual identity are those aspects of the person that are not the product of duplication and that cannot themselves be duplicated. Beneath such claims is the commonplace that "personality," like the Cartesian "soul," functions as a principle of mystery or exception: the self may have sources (to borrow a phrase from philosopher Charles Taylor), but it is properly neither reducible to them nor reproducible from them. This ineffability serves as shorthand for the comforting fiction that who and what we are cannot be exhaustively defined by our histories, our education, or a tangle of electrochemical impulses&#x2014;what the mid twentieth-century cultural critic Dwight Macdonald called "mere congeries of conditioned reflexes." No matter how well cultural or biological determinism may explain the nature of cognition, or memory, or desire, there is always irreproducible magic somewhere. To assert a self (as an "artist" or as anything else) through imitation is to impugn this principle of exceptionality. Put another way: to set the copy where the original should be is to undo the connection between individuality and differentiation that underwrites the popular idea of modern personality. Although Freudian psychology characterizes the process of identification as an essential tool in the delineation of the subject&#x2014;whereby the subject assimilates an aspect of the Other and is transformed by the model that the Other provides&#x2014;persistent, nondevelopmental imitation is pathological. Such terms can be found in anthropological discourse, too: the ethnographer Clifford Geertz defines the self as a "bounded, unique, more or less integrated motivational and cognitive universe, a dynamic center of awareness, emotion, judgment, and action, organized into a distinctive whole and set contrastively against other such wholes." Copying blurs distinctions of mine and thine&#x2014;both physically and metaphysically&#x2014;and must be disavowed in order for the contrasts that define that "center of awareness" to hold. Imitation is suicide, in other words, because it denies the premises of what the philosopher Jean Baudrillard calls the "differential vicissitudes" and "aleatory charm" of individuality&#x2014;it threatens to reduce us to clones.</p><p>In highlighting the relationship between artistic expression and assertions of autonomy, the point I wish to make here is relatively straightforward: a signed, public display of the statement "Imitation is Suicide" neatly distills the modern ideology of American liberal individualism in both its popular and more specialized forms. For all of its universalizing intent, however, the text of Stel/Sim's graffiti (and the ideas about self and aesthetic expression that it encapsulates) has a very particular history. The phrase comes directly from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay on "Self-Reliance," first delivered in 1836 and subsequently published in 1841: "There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given him to till." Hence the punchline of the piece: Stel/Sim's clarion call for originality is about as dependent and unoriginal as can be. As an unattributed (but not especially obscure) quotation, its arguments about the artist and the self are categorically undermined by their expression.</p><p>Origin Stories</p><p>Ironies aside, I begin with Stel/Sim and Emerson in order to make an initial claim about the ways in which the imitative, the iterative, and the derivative have been systematically devalued in contemporary culture and to locate the roots of that devaluation (at least in part) in historically specific arguments. Although it may seem to have been with us forever, the American obsession with individuation and originality is not natural or inherent but contingent; it is the product of specific nineteenth-century ideological circumstances. Attending briefly to that cultural moment in which imitation becomes conflated with suicide can help set the stage for understanding the more protean moment that comes before&#x2014;the colonial and early republican periods at the heart of this book&#x2014;in which different sorts of copying were essential to the artistic, psychological, and political projects associated with national independence.</p><p>Early in his 1838 address to the graduating class at Harvard Divinity School, for example, Emerson&#x2014;lately resigned from his pastorate in Lexington, Massachusetts, and continuing to turn away from organized Christianity&#x2014;warns his audience about the perils of preaching according to convention. "[Certain divine laws] refuse to be adequately stated. They will not be written out on paper, or spoken by the tongue. . . . The moral traits which are all globed into every virtuous act and thought,&#x2014;in speech, we must sever, and describe or suggest by painful enumeration of many particulars." This is not, in and of itself, a particularly groundbreaking sentiment. Paul's second letter to the Corinthians ("Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life") makes essentially the same case: the manmade rules of grammar and logic chop up and parcel out a divinity that is rightly unitary; the true Word of God cannot be stated according to the strictures of the page and must be written, immaterially, on the heart. "These [divine] laws execute themselves[,]" Emerson continues, "They are out of time, out of space, and not subject to circumstance" until they are abjected into the temporal, spatial, and circumstantial realm of human expression.</p><p>If the frame is old, though, Emerson uses it for new and particular ends. Where Paul makes a case for his own apostolic authority&#x2014;the special investment of Christ with divinity lends his evangelists the "commendation" to conduct a "ministration of the spirit," in order to redeem humanity from the written condemnations of the Old Testament&#x2014;Emerson makes a case for a considerably more diffuse (or democratic) experience of revelation. In the Divinity School Address, infinitude knows no privilege; it invests all selves uniquely but also equally, spontaneously; it neither brooks nor expects any sort of external or collective explanation. A sense of the unique relation in which one stands to God "corrects the capital mistake of the infant man, who seeks to be great by following the great, and hopes to derive advantages <i>from another</i>,&#x2014;by showing the fountain of all good to be in himself, and that he, equally with every man, is an inlet into the deeps of Reason." What starts as an argument about evangelical modesty and divine ineffability, in other words, becomes an argument about the necessary sovereignty of the individual.</p><p>In the introduction to <i>Nature </i>(1836), Emerson had put the same point even more bluntly. He famously opens that essay with an echo of the Kantian imperative <i>Sapere aude</i>: when contemplating the mysteries of the world, have the courage to think for yourself. "Our age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchres of the fathers. It writes biographies, histories, and criticism. The foregoing generations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe?" The axiomatic desirability of this "original relation to the universe" serves as both the heart of Continental Enlightenment philosophy and the organizing principle of Transcendentalist epistemology. The wager of Emersonian thought is that the highest laws of the cosmos are present and identifiable in all things, from the most ethereal to the most concrete&#x2014;that every thinking person may thus begin to recognize "the currents of the Universal Being [that] circulate through [her]" and may sense that she is "part or particle of God"&#x2014;even if she can't put that sensation into words. Like his prose, Emerson's cosmology is essentially fractal: because the same laws that animate the universe animate the particular being, the individual needs nothing more than a properly tuned sensibility to begin to see how she fits into the systems of creation and to approach the cosmos's profoundest truths. Looking inward, one finds the unspeakable proofs of divinity that the consultation of other people's material expressions (written biographies, histories, criticisms) destroys.</p><p>In "Self-Reliance," Emerson frames the necessity of an "original relation to the universe" even more forcefully. Elaborating his sense of the singularity and immateriality of the self&#x2014;in <i>Nature</i>, he divides the universe into the soul and the "NOT ME," which includes "both nature and art, all other men and my own body"&#x2014;Emerson argues that "the relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure that it is profane to seek to interpose helps." These "helps" are things like "culture" or "society" or "convention"&#x2014;whatever locates authority or wisdom beyond an individual's own power of apprehension has the capacity to disrupt (or disprove) the relays of Transcendence. "Society everywhere," he argues, "is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue most in request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion." Against this joint-stock conspiracy, Emerson posits the necessary uniqueness of Manhood&#x2014;a spiritual and intellectual independence that finds looks beyond accepted names and customs to the real majesty they cannot translate. In <i>Nature</i>'s famous claim that he has "enjoyed a perfect exhilaration" and been made "glad to the brink of fear" even when "crossing a bare common, in snow puddles, at twilight, under a clouded sky," Emerson casts himself as what he calls "Man thinking." He sees in those things that custom holds mundane and homely the deep organizing structures of Creation. To adopt the perceptions or philosophical procedures of others&#x2014;to acknowledge conformity as a virtue&#x2014;would be to both deny the divinity of those things that the culture abjures and to refuse your own participation in the universal.</p><p>Emerson's peroration to the Divinity School Address thus presents the six young graduates before him a very clear program:</p><blockquote>Let me admonish you, first of all, to go alone; to refuse the good models, even those which are sacred in the imagination of men, and dare to love God without mediator or veil. Friends enough you shall find who will hold up to your emulation Wesleys and Oberlins, Saints and Prophets. Thank God for these good men, but say, "I also am a man." Imitation cannot go above its model. The imitator dooms himself to hopeless mediocrity. The inventor did it because it was something natural to him, and so in him it was a charm.

K. Chesterton series.</strong></p><p>There are certainly many studies of Saint Francis of Assisi that an interested reader might find and many of them immensely praiseworthy. But in reading G.K. Chesterton on Francis, you get two glories for one: first is an enlightening study of this most beloved of Christian saints and second is Chesterton himself, one of the great Christian writers of the 20th century, who converted to Roman Catholicism in 1922 because, it has been said, "only the Roman Church could produce a St. Francis of Assisi." Published shortly after his conversion, Chesterton wrote this book in part to reclaim Francis for the church. There are always those who want to claim Francis for their cause, Chesterton recognized, who also fail to understand the spiritual and intellectual ground upon which he stands. Chesterton would return Francis to Christ. As he summarizes, "however wild and romantic his gyrations might appear to many, [Francis] always hung on to reason by one invisible and indestructible hair.... The great saint was sane.... He was not a mere eccentric because he was always turning towards the center and heart of the maze; he took the queerest and most zigzag shortcuts through the wood, but he was always going home." <p> As one editor of Chesterton's puts it, "of St. Francis he might have said what he said about Blake: 'We always feel that he is saying something very plain and emphatic even when we have not the wildest notion of what it is.'" <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>Francis of Assisi is, after Mary of Nazareth, the greatest saint in the Christian calendar, and one of the most influential men in the whole of human history. By universal acclaim, this biography by G. K. Chesterton is considered the best appreciation of Francis's life--the one that gets to the heart of the matter. <p></p> <p>For Chesterton, Francis is a great paradoxical figure, a man who loved women but vowed himself to chastity; an artist who loved the pleasures of the natural world as few have loved them, but vowed himself to the most austere poverty, stripping himself naked in the public square so all could see that he had renounced his worldly goods; a clown who stood on his head in order to see the world aright. Chesterton gives us Francis in his world-the riotously colorful world of the High Middle Ages, a world with more pageantry and romance than we have seen before or since. Here is the Francis who tried to end the Crusades by talking to the Saracens, and who interceded with the emperor on behalf of the birds. Here is the Francis who inspired a revolution in art that began with Giotto and a revolution in poetry that began with Dante. Here is the Francis who prayed and danced with pagan abandon, who talked to animals, who invented the creche.</p></p><h2>The Stars&#39; Tennis Balls</h2><p>A novel about a man getting in touch with his emotions...spite, jealousy &amp; revenge.<br><br>For Ned, 1980 seems a blissful year.

At first the discussion was detached; Mr. Manchester was writing his Portrait of a President. But soon they were conversing as two men do who have lived many of the same years in the same places. Both were natives of Massachusetts. As a World War II Marine on Guadalcanal, Manchester had been separated by only a narrow strait from Kennedy's PT-109 base on Tulagi. They had both been awarded Purple Hearts before leaving the Pacific. Now they were fathers of daughters the same age, had traveled in the same foreign countries, and shared a deep interest in American history.<br><br>More than two years later, following the assassination of President Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy realized that she and others would be obliged to share their recollections of the national tragedy with a responsible writer--and so she and Senator Robert Kennedy asked Mr. Manchester to set down a history of the assassination and the days immediately preceding and following it.<br><br>At the invitation of the Chief Justice, Mr. Manchester was a privileged observer of the Warren Commission inquiry. Meanwhile, however, he had developed his own sources of information.

Cousin to Elizabeth I - and very likely also Henry VIII&#39;s illegitimate granddaughter - Lettice Knollys had a life of dizzying highs and pitiful lows. Darling of the court, entangled in a love triangle with Robert Dudley and Elizabeth I, banished from court, plagued by scandals of affairs and murder, embroiled in treason, Lettice would go on to lose a husband and beloved son to the executioner&#39;s axe. Living to the astonishing age of ninety-one, Lettice&#39;s tale gives us a remarkable, personal lens on to the grand sweep of the Tudor Age, with those closest to her often at the heart of the events that defined it.

The Extra-Terrestrial , mistakes clutter for cleverness. Attached to a threadbare plot about the editors of a fifth-rate scandal sheet trying to save a friend from the clutches of a New York Mafia don named Tony Baloney are more madcap characters than one would want to encounter in 10 novels: wisecracking cabbies, a bubble-headed porn queen, an epileptic mad artist, and an exhausting assortment of soothsayers, goons and deranged editors. All have colorful names (Hip O'Hopp, Mitzi Mouse, Hattie Flyer) to match their personal oddities. Unfortunately, Kotzwinkle puts them through a screwball plot that's more strenuous than exhilarating. After a promising start which captures the desperate humor of people trapped in jobs that embarrass them, the novel gives way to a dogged procession of fistfights and chases, all narrated by a hack journalist in an I've-seen-it-all-and-then-some tone that runs out of comic steam long before the story ends. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kotzwinkle's new novel describes lifeat Chameleon Publications, the home of Knockers, Macho Man, Ladies Own Monthly , and a sleazy, sensational tabloid, The Midnight Examiner. The editors struggle to find ways to reuse each other's copy, write headlines, and meet their deadlines, while trying desperately to avoid the poisoned darts from publisher Nathan Fringold's blowgun. Life imitates "art" as these sophisticated--if somewhat eccentric--New Yorkers do battle with the Mafia to save the life of a porn star. An alcoholic reporter, a self-ordained cardinal, a wilting beauty queen, and an Egyptian grave robber-turned-cab driver round out the zany, yet credible, cast of characters. This is a funny, irreverent book that will appeal to anyone with a taste for ribald humor. Highly recommended.<br><i>- William Gargan, Brooklyn Coll.

Yes, there is: British journalist Parker, whose account focuses on the Windsors' youthful indiscretions, their ties with the Nazis, and, particularly, corruption in the Bahamas while the Duke was Governor.

In their startling new book, authors Brown and Eisenhardt contend that to prosper in such volatile conditions, standard survival strategies must be tossed aside in favor of a revolutionary new paradigm&#x2014;competing on the edge. To compete on the edge is to relentlessly reinvent, and it's the only way to navigate the treacherous waters of tumultuous markets. Competing on the edge is an unpredictable, sometimes even inefficient strategy, yet a singularly effective one in an era driven by change. It requires charting a course along the edge of chaos, where a delicate compromise is struck between anarchy and order, to the edge of time, where current business is the primary focus, but actions are shaped by past legacies and future opportunities. By adroitly maneuvering through chaos and time, managers can avoid constantly reacting to nonstop change and instead set a rhythmic pace that others must follow, thereby shaping the competitive landscape&#x2014;and their own destiny. In the first book to translate leading edge concepts from complexity theory into management practice, each chapter focuses on a specific management dilemma and illustrates a solution. Linking where do you want to go? With how will you get there? Here's a bold and surprising strategy that works&#x2014;when the name of the game is change.</p><p>What do the Atlanta Braves, Microsoft, 3M, Nike, and Intel all have in common? According to Shona Brown and Kathleen Eisenhardt, authors of <i>Competing on the Edge: Strategy as Structured Chaos</i>, each of these organizations are predictably unpredictable. They're leaders not because of their ability to predict the course of their markets; rather, these companies have learned to embrace the notion of change. They're successful because they've learned to find that edge between structure and chaos that allows them to be innovative and creative, while maintaining just enough discipline to focus on executing a plan. <p> The authors contend that competing on the edge is not an efficient or predictable way to do business. Instead, it's learning how to adapt and lead in a business environment that's in a constant state of flux. "The underlying insight behind competing on the edge is that strategy is the result of a firm's organizing to change constantly and letting a semicoherent strategic direction emerge from that organization. In other words, it is about combining the two parts of strategy by simultaneously addressing where you want to go and how you are going to get there." </p><p> Brown and Eisenhardt offer dozens of examples of companies that are successfully and not so successfully finding that balance between anarchy and order. If, on the one hand, you feel like your company is bogged down by rules and bureaucracy or if,on the other, it seems like no one in your company knows exactly what they're doing, you'll find that <i>Competing on the Edge</i> is a valuable handbook for change. The book is clearly written, full of insight, and belongs on every manager's bookshelf. Highly recommended. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i></p><b>Shona L.

He is also the illustrator of A CHRISTMAS CAROL. He lives in Dublin, Ireland.Ages 4^-9. "Christmas is pish-posh," grumbles Jonathan Toomey, the best wood carver in the valley. He's a Scroogelike recluse; but he's a gentle grouch, it turns out, and he hides a sad secret. He's transformed, not by Dickensian ghosts, but by an eager seven-year-old boy and his widowed mother who ask him to make them a Christmas creche. The story verges on the sentimental, but it's told with feeling and lyricism (he "traveled till his tears stopped" ). Lynch's sweeping illustrations, in shades of wood grain, are both realistic and gloriously romantic, focusing on faces and hands at work before the fire and in the lamplight. In a beautiful, elemental scene, the angry wood carver stands on the threshold of his home, disturbed by the gentle widow and her son who want his help and will transform his life. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Don&#39;t Mess With Moses!: Peculiar Poems and Rib-Tickling Rhymes</h2><p><p>Humorous and edgy, these Scripture-based poems are written with a nod to the style of Shel Silverstein.

First-year detective Kathleen Doyle and Chief Inspector MichaelSinclair, Lord Acton, are a most unlikely pair. An Irish redhead of humble beginnings and modest means, Doyle is the antithesis of Acton, the British lord who has established himself as a brilliant but enigmatic figure with a knack for solving London&#39;s most high profile homicides.

Doyle&#x2019;s gift for reading people makes her invaluable to the veteran inspector, yet she struggles to keep her coveted entry position and build on her meager education by using multisyllabic words she&#x2019;s researched and practiced to enlarge her vocabulary and impress Acton. Their growing bond is deftly depicted by Cleeland as Acton quietly offers a loan to Doyle, who is trying to make ends meet. From pride and professionalism, she declines, but the telling incident lingers powerfully for her, just as this entertaining pair will linger in readers&#x2019; imaginations, making them want more. Their first venture in a planned series involves a racecourse trainer, possibly involved with dangerous underworld types, whose murder is quickly followed by his girlfriend&#x2019;s. Hopefully, the sequel will follow quickly, too. --Whitney Scott</p><h2>The Brueg(H)el Phenomenon: Paintings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Pieter Brueghel the Younger with a Special Focus on Technique and Copying Practice (Scientia Artis, 3-volume set)</h2><p>The fascination exerted by the works of the illustrious Pieter Bruegel the Elder in the decades following his death in 1569 is matched only by the intense interest they generate today. At the end of the sixteenth century and in the first half of the seventeenth, the most ambitious art collectors fought over the few paintings by the master that were still on the market. This setting was the catalyst for the appearance of copies and pastiches and even deliberate forgeries. It was then that the elder son of Pieter Bruegel, known as Pieter Brueghel the Younger (whose name is spelled Brueghel here, conforming to the signature that he adopted during the initial phase of his career) emerged as a legitimate successor, producing astonishingly faithful replicas of his father s paintings. This was all the more surprising given that they were often made after works that were by then dispersed in diverse and sometimes inaccessible private collections. Operating within the context of a sizeable workshop, Brueghel supplied the market with hundreds of copies of variable quality according to demand. This enterprise merited re-evaluation from a technical point of view: how were such vast numbers of copies produced in practice? <p> This three-volume book explores the intriguing Brueg[H]el phenomenon through the two artists painting practices. The technical aspects of their works are investigated in a detective-like manner and are strikingly elucidated with a wealth of colour illustrations. The reader will come to understand the accomplished practitioner behind the genius that is Bruegel the Elder and the working procedures of his foremost emulator s workshop. Furthermore, Brueghel the Younger s exceptional qualities as a painter are singled out from those of his workshop production. The book also reveals fresh discoveries on the father s creative process through the study of his son's copies.</p></p><p></p><h2>The New Testament in its World Work Book</h2><p><p>The work book will follow the structure of the textbook, as follows:</p><p>1.

Mr. Foster has written novelizations of many popular fantasy and science fiction films, including <i>Star Wars</i> and the <i>Alien</i> films. He and his family live in Prescott, AZ.Born with the wonderfully illustrated children's-book-for-all-ages that gave it its name, the Dinotopia phenomenon has produced two best-selling books, is incubating a feature film, and now hatches a novel by prolific and popular fantasist Foster. Lacking the added dimension of artwork that made the first two Dinotopia books so dazzling, the book is still a well-told tale. It continues the sentimental environmental utopianism and dinosaur-hugging of its predecessors and reasonable amounts of their wit and ingenuity, too. The plot revolves around a band of pirates whose ship miraculously survives the reefs around Dinotopia and who set out to turn what they find there to profit. Will Denison, the nineteenth-century discoverer of the symbiotic human-saurian society, is dragged into taking a leading part in defeating the pirates, most of whom are converted to the Dinotopian way of life (the rest are converted into dino munchies, especially on account of their less-than-brilliant kidnapping of a baby <i>T. Rex</i>). Although the saurian characters are better limned than the human ones, Foster's addition to Dinotopiana will agreeably reward the fantastic place's many fans. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>The Hidden Injuries of Class</h2><p>Hole punched into front cover, else minimal shelf wear to cover.

Provocative, funny, and outrageous--Roddick tells her story, and expresses her unconventional views on hype, greed, caring and communion.</p><p>In case the title fails to warn you, this is a somewhat unfocused inspirational corporate history by the entrepreneurial cult heroine who founded the wildly remunerative ``environmentally conscious'' cosmetics company called The Body Shop. What the book doesn't tell you: anything about the financial or marketing nuts and bolts of how Roddick turned one little provincial English store into a worldwide chain and manufacturer of ``natural'' remedies worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Still, the story has interest--as the chronicle of a hippie woman from Littlehampton, England, tossed willy-nilly into the last decade's economic boom and making the most of it, and as a manifesto for environmentally pure and socially responsible business practices. In respect to the latter, Roddick advocates a ban on animal testing; increased corporate campaigns for saving the whales, preserving the rain forests, and disarming the world; a soft retail sell; recyclable products; and placing factories in undeveloped regions, such as Easterhouse, Scotland--where, Roddick writes, ``we employed the unemployable,'' who ``fell in like lambs.'' (Unions are necessary only when the managers are ``bastards.'') She attributes The Body Shop's success to ``passion'': ``I have never been able to separate Body Shop values from my own personal values,'' she boasts, and delineates them fully. How did Roddick force all 600-odd Body Shop operators to adopt her green-and-white color scheme while maintaining a corporate ``democracy''? What is the exact financial structure of this profitable ``social experiment''? We don't find out here, but we may be inspired to expand our own little business in homage. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In 1976, Roddick needed to support her two children while her husband rode a horse from Buenos Aires to New York. So in Brighton, England, she opened a small shop that sold cosmetics made only from natural ingredients. Despite protests from the neighboring funeral parlor, she called it The Body Shop. Today, Roddick heads a public company with a chain of more than 600 shops and a successful international franchising system. As she writes in her introduction, this book is not a conventional autobiography or business book; rather, it's the story of her personal vision of what business should be. Roddick intersperses autobiographical details with criticisms of the cosmetics industry. Espousing principles of social and environmental responsibility, she describes The Body Shop's Trade Not Aid program in the Third World and its campaign to save the Amazon rainforest. At times, Roddick's lecturing becomes tedious, and some of her ideas, while well-intended (giving the Amazon Indians video cameras to record their culture), are questionable. Still, her passion amd her infectious enthusiasm make her book a cut above the usual gray "How I Succeeded" tomes.

What few know is that in the early years of the Soviet state, an incredible coup took place.<br><br>Lenin's Will presents a fascinating, detailed account of political intrigue at the center of power in 1922 and 1923, when Vladimir Ilyich Lenin - the father of the Revolution - lay incapacitated by several severe strokes. Previously top-secret documents, here published for the first time, reveal how Josef Stalin (a close political associate), and the Central Committee of the Communist Party deliberately collaborated to falsify and suppress Lenin's last political testament and take control of the young Soviet government. Reaching into the once highly secret document files of the Soviet archives, Yuri Buranov has combed the hidden recesses of Communist Party plotting to reveal the power plays and back-room intrigues that helped make Stalin the unquestioned successor to Lenin and an abolsute dictator feared both at home and abroad.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: RussianLenin, in deathbed letters and other dictations which became known as his "will," warned of Stalin's thirst for power while giving Trotsky mixed praise. Stalin was able to conceal this document until Max Eastman revealed its existence in his 1926 book, Since Lenin Died. In a study which amply quotes from memos and other papers, Buranov, a history professor in Moscow, suggests that Stalin reworded and falsified Lenin's original directives. Tapping the Communist Party archives, Buranov reproduces a handwritten document of Stalin's wife, Nadezhda Alliluyeva--one of Lenin's secretaries--which differs from the typescript of the same document and seems to indicate Stalin's treachery at work. Although this comprises the author's only evidence for his contentions, Buranov notes that we may never know whether Stalin reworded Lenin's "will," since other handwritten reports of Lenin's dictations were destroyed. Nevertheless, this dense study sheds light on the fierce power struggle that ended with Stalin as absolute dictator. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Beyond Slavery: Explorations of Race, Labor, and Citizenship in Postemancipation Societies</h2><p>In this collaborative work, three leading historians explore one of the most significant areas of inquiry in modern historiography--the transition from slavery to freedom and what this transition meant for former slaves, former slaveowners, and the societies in which they lived. Their contributions take us beyond the familiar portrait of emancipation as the end of an evil system to consider the questions and the struggles that emerged in freedom&#39;s wake. Thomas Holt focuses on emancipation in Jamaica and the contested meaning of citizenship in defining and redefining the concept of freedom; Rebecca Scott investigates the complex struggles and cross-racial alliances that evolved in southern Louisiana and Cuba after the end of slavery; and Frederick Cooper examines the intersection of emancipation and imperialism in French West Africa.

Before the Civil War, Kentucky was a slave state, while Ohio remained free.

These dangerous journeys demanded a tremendous amount of courage, planning, and faith.&nbsp;<i>Freedom</i><i> River</i> is based on a true story of one man&#x2019;s determination to help an African American family escape from slavery along the legendary Underground Railroad.<br></p><p>Doreen Rappaport has written several award-winning books for children, including <i>The School Is Not White!,</i> illustrated by Curtis James; <i>Martin&#x2019;s Big Words,</i> a Caldecott Honor Book, a Coretta Scott King Honor for Illustration, and a Jane Addams Children&#x2019;s Book Award winner; <i>Freedom River,</i> an ALA Notable Book and winner of a Coretta Scott King Honor for Illustration; and <i>John&#x2019;s Secret Dreams: The Life of John Lennon,</i> all illustrated by Bryan Collier. Rappaport lives and writes in upstate New York.Gr. 3-5. Based on a true slave escape story, this picture book for older children combines an exciting, heartrending narrative with dramatic collage and watercolor pictures. John Parker was an ex-slave who became a successful businessman and an active conductor on the Underground Railroad. On one of his journeys, he helped an African American couple escape with their baby from the slave state of Kentucky to the free state of Ohio. The white owner knew the slave parents would never leave their child behind, so he had the baby sleep at the foot of his bed; but Parker stole the baby, tricked the master, and led the family across the river to freedom. Rappaport frames the incident with a biography of Parker, who may have helped as many as 900 African Americans. In a note, illustrator Bryan Collier speaks about his pictures, but his main commentary is about his own religion: he believes that Parker's story is about the power of prayer. His spiritual message will appeal to some readers; others will find it intrusive and simply focus on the inspiring story and stirring narrative pictures. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

In the days following the Rapture of Christ&#x2019;s Church, the ultimate enemy of God raised up his primary human agent to carry out his diabolical mission, Salvador Romanero. The Miracle Maker, as Salvador Romanero was known throughout the world&#x2014;after various predictions he&#x2019;d made had all come true&#x2014;was about to perform his greatest miracle: bringing peace to a tiny country that had lived in constant fear since its inception, the nation of Israel. But instead of a peace treaty being signed, Jerusalem fell under a sneak attack on that day. In just six hours, more blood was shed in the streets of the Holy Land than any at other time in Israel&#x2019;s turbulent history. Much of the city was in shambles. Smoke smoldered from buildings. The most notable was the Dome of the Rock. The Muslim shrine that was constructed in Jerusalem back in the 7th century now lay in ruins. Muslims all over the world mourned bitterly. Mourning very quickly turned into outrage when Salvador Romanero announced to the world that the Dome of the Rock would never be rebuilt. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims flooded the Holy Land seeking revenge. But it wasn&#x2019;t just Muslims Salvador Romanero was out to silence. Anyone opposing the one world government he was putting in motion&#x2014;to include a one world religion&#x2014;would eventually be silenced for good. As the Miracle Maker set out to create a brave new world, children of the Most High God were preparing for the absolute worst. They knew God&#x2019;s unprecedented judgments were coming. After all, it was written. They also knew Salvador Romanero was the long-foretold Antichrist of the Bible, and there was nothing they could do to stop the Son of Perdition in his quest for global worship. Initially, Clayton Holmes and Travis Hartings, founders of the End Times Salvation Movement, used a website to connect them to other new believers also left behind on that fateful day. Both men prayed for weeks on end that God would give them a surefire sign, so they would know who was trustworthy or not. For three consecutive nights they had the very same dream. Both heard a voice saying, &#x2018;Those who contact you regarding this dream are trustworthy.&#x2019; Knowing the Most High God was using supernatural dreams to bring His children together in these end times, while many showed interest in joining their rapidly growing organization, only those who&#x2019;d had certain dreams were deemed trustworthy and invited to live on the properties they would soon have in their possession. But with the second attempt to sign a peace treaty with Israel now upon them, the chaotic world humanity had inherited after the Rapture, would soon come completely unglued. Instead of peace and prosperity for all, Planet Earth would experience the most turbulent seven years humanity would ever know...</p><p></p><h2>The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross</h2><p>Compared to the Freemasons with whom they are sometimes confused, Rosicrucians seem like explorers at the heart of a mystery. A secret, fraternal order devoted to occult studies, the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, as it is sometimes called, may well be both older and more doctrinally complex than its Masonic counterpart. Officially beginning in Germany around 1614, Rosicrucianism may have been several centuries older. Waite discusses the precursors of the movement -- some with legitimate claims, others not -- dating as far back as the first century A.D. Kabalists, alchemists, and mystics, such as Jacob Boehme, and Raymond Lully, are featured in Waite&#39;s discussion of the development of Rosicrucian symbolism, and the evolution of its notions of the origins of life and the substance of the soul. The bulk of the book, however, is devoted to the rising and falling fortunes of the Brotherhood since its formal entry into the world after the appearance of several pamphlets, written by Christian Rosenkruez (psuedonym of Johan Andrea, and origin of the name of the order) in the early 17th century.</p><p>Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.</p><h2>Be Careful What You Wish For (The Clifton Chronicles)</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>JEFFREY ARCHER was educated at Oxford University. He has served five years in Britain&#39;s House of Commons and nineteen years in the House of Lords. All of his novels and short story collections--including &#34;Best Kept Secret,&#34; &#34;The&#34;&#34;Sins of the Father,&#34; &#34;Kane and Abel,&#34; and &#34;False Impression&#34;--have been international bestselling books. Archer is married with two sons and lives in London and Cambridge.The Clifton Chronicles&#x2019; fourth volume takes the saga from the late 1950s to the mid-&#x2019;60s. The book begins with a shocker: Harry and Emma&#x2019;s son, Sebastian, is nearly killed in an automobile accident; his friend Bruno does die. It seems Sebastian was the intended target, and Bruno&#x2019;s father, Don Pedro Martinez, who has a long and contentious history with the Cliftons (and who didn&#x2019;t know his own son was in the car), is the likely culprit. If you don&#x2019;t know who any of these people are, you may want to start at the saga&#x2019;s beginning, 2011&#x2019;s Only Time Will Tell, because this is an epic-size family drama, operatic in scope. This fourth book focuses on upheavals inside the Barrington Shipping Company: mystery-novelist Harry Clifton&#x2019;s wife, Emma, is descended from the company&#x2019;s founder and wants to take over as company chairman, but Don Pedro, with a seething hatred of the Barringtons, has his own plans for the suddenly vacant chairman&#x2019;s seat. As with the previous volumes in the series, there are myriad subplots winding their way through the book: Harry and Emma&#x2019;s daughter is engaged, for example, but there are those who aren&#x2019;t so thrilled about that, and a new member of the Barrington company&#x2019;s upper echelon is a fellow whose agenda is a troubling mystery. Reaction to the Clifton Chronicles has not been unanimously positive&#x2014;Archer has his detractors&#x2014;but if you like multivolume family sagas, it would be hard to find a contemporary example as ambitious and entertaining as this one. --David Pitt</p><h2>Connie Mack: The Turbulent and Triumphant Years, 1915-1931</h2><p>The Philadelphia Athletics dominated the first fourteen years of the American League, winning six pennants through 1914 under the leadership of their founder and manager, Connie Mack. But beginning in 1915, where volume 2 in Norman L. Macht&#x2019;s biography picks up the story, Mack&#x2019;s teams fell from pennant winners to last place and, in an unprecedented reversal of fortunes, stayed there for seven years. World War I robbed baseball of young players, and Mack&#x2019;s rebuilding efforts using green youngsters of limited ability made his teams the objects of public ridicule. <br>At the age of fifty-nine and in the face of widespread skepticism and seemingly insurmountable odds, Connie Mack reasserted his genius, remade the A&#x2019;s, and rose again to the top, even surpassing his earlier success. Baseball biographer and historian Macht recreates what may be the most remarkable chapter in this larger-than-life story. He shows us the man and his time and the game of baseball in all its nitty-gritty glory of the 1920s, and how Connie Mack built the 1929&#x2013;1931 champions of Foxx, Simmons, Cochrane, Grove, Earnshaw, Miller, Haas, Bishop, Dykes&#x2014;a team many consider baseball&#x2019;s greatest ever.</p><p>Norman L.

It was the end of a race that had gripped the country more than any other. Every likely candidate would be a first in the White House, whether by race (Obama) or gender (Senator Hillary Clinton, Alaska Governor, Sarah Palin). This detailed scrapbook recreates one of the most inspiring presidential races in U.S. history. Tucked among the pages is a treasure trove of memorabilia: souvenir replicas such as buttons, press passes, bumper stickers, posters, tickets, and more are set against a vivid narrative, historical photographs, and images from the campaign trail.

It's too bad that through lack of foresight the inauguration happens so early in the year: A few months from now, the cherry trees along the Tidal Basin will surely be putting out Obamablossoms. For those whose appetite for Barackabilia has yet to be sated, Barack Obama: 44th President, by Avery Krut (Whitman, $49.95), may be just the ticket. Not so much a book as a cupboard between hard covers, it is full of tickets, bumper stickers, reprints of speeches, penciled letters from admiring kids and all sorts of other electioneering byproducts, each tucked into its own envelope-like slot. My favorite page, however, is one without a prize to be extracted: a photo of a mock swearing-in of Obama as a U.S. senator on January 5, 2005. (The actual ceremony took place the day before.) Administering the mock-oath is Vice President Dick Cheney, whose affable grin suggests he has no idea what he has set in motion. Once the man of the hour is ensconced in the White House, his wife, Michelle, might want to prepare herself for the letters she will get (along with e-mails, textings, twitters and other cybercorrespondence) by perusing Dear First Lady: Letters to the White House from the Collections of the Library of Congress &amp; National Archives, by Dwight Young and Margaret Johnson (National Geographic, $25). There are tragic notes: Lyndon Johnson writing to former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy shortly after her husband's assassination to express his admiration for the way she was bearing up, and assuring her, "I only wish things could be different -- that I didn't have to be here." And there are amusing ones, such as the president of the Auto Dismantlers Association of Southern California writing Mrs. Johnson to inform her that he is stung by her "criticism of the appearance of many of the nation's auto dismantling yards"; he angles for an invite to the upcoming White House Conference on Natural Beauty as a way of making amends. Missing from the book, however, are any letters written to one of the most colorful first ladies of all: Lucy Webb Hayes, known as Lemonade Lucy for her insistence on teetotaling by everyone inside the White House. My high school American history teacher liked to relate how rebellious guests used to get the better of Her Lemonadeness: slipping outside to booze with a vengeance, ending up "stacked like cordwood on the White House lawn." Out beyond the White House lawn and the Tidal Basin live The Americans, as seen in a photography book of the same name by Robert Frank (Steidl, $39.95). Reissued to mark the 50th anniversary of its first publication, The Americans collects pictures taken by the Swiss-born photographer in 1955 and '56, when he was bankrolled by a Guggenheim grant. Some of the scenes have a time-capsule quality: a man getting a shoeshine in an anything-but-fancy bathroom; a lunch counter full-up with patrons sitting beneath "Orange Whip 10 cents" signs; convertibles pointed at a drive-in movie screen. It was an era when men wore hats, women wore furs, and jukeboxes were the size of phone booths. Jack Kerouac sums up the work's effect in his rampaging introduction: "Robert Frank . . . unobtrusive, nice, with that little camera that he raises and snaps with one hand he sucked a sad poem right out of America onto film, taking rank among the tragic poets of the world." An exhibition of Frank's photos has just opened at the National Gallery. Nothing comes tumbling out of 100 American Flags: A Unique Collection of Old Glory Memorabilia, collection and design by Kit Hinrichs, text by Delphine Hirasuna, photography by Terry Heffernan (Ten Speed, $19.95). But its still photos show that today's Obamapreneurs are only upholding an honored tradition of patriotic kitsch. How can you not savor the flag-embossed poker chips and the deck of Victory playing cards with Uncle Sam as the king, Miss Liberty as the queen and Adolf Hitler as the joker? Not to mention the antiwar flag from the Vietnam War era on which silhouetted bombers take the place of the stars and rifles stand in for the bars. Lemonade Lucy would have been appalled at the use to which a flag was put after the U.S. triumph at the Battle of Manila in 1898: adorning a celebratory whiskey flask. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Parrots, once the miraculous, articulate companions of popes and emperors, declined into figures of mindless mimicry. Cats, which were tortured by Catholics in the Middle Ages, were tortured in the Reformation as part of the Protestant attack on Catholicism. And sheep, the model for Agnus Dei imagery, underwent transformations at once legal, material, and spiritual as a result of their changing role in Europe's growing manufacturing and trade economies. While in the Middle Ages these nonhumans were endowed with privileged social associations, personal agency, even the ability to reason and speak, in the early modern period they lost these qualities at the very same time that a new emphasis on, and understanding of, human character was developing in European literature.</p><p>In <i>Animal Characters</i> Bruce Thomas Boehrer follows five species&#x2014;the horse, the parrot, the cat, the turkey, and the sheep&#x2014;through their appearances in an eclectic mix of texts, from romances and poetry to cookbooks and natural histories. He shows how dramatic changes in animal character types between 1400 and 1700 relate to the emerging economy and culture of the European Renaissance. In early modern European culture, animals not only served humans as sources of labor, companionship, clothing, and food; these nonhuman creatures helped to form an understanding of personhood. Incorporating readings of Shakespeare's plays, Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Margaret Cavendish's <i>Blazing World</i>, and other works, Boehrer's series of animal character studies illuminates a fascinating period of change in interspecies relationships.</p></p><p>Bruce Thomas Boehrer is Bertram H.

While making the usual rounds, he had the misfortune to send his novel to the American offices of Dial, whose response he recalled two years later in a letter to his agent, Leonard Moore: "I am not sure whether one can count on the American public grasping what [<i>Animal Farm</i>] is about. You may remember that the Dial Press had been asking me for some years for a manuscript, but when I sent the MS of [<i>AF[</i> in 1944 they returned it, saying shortly that 'it was impossible to sell animal stories in the USA.' Just recently they wrote saying that 'there had been some mistake' and that they would like to make another offer for the book. I rather gather they had at first taken it for a bona fide animal story" (Orwell 4:110). For Orwell (who never had much use for the United States), this incident reflects on the obtuseness of the American reading public; for me, it says more about the failures of the literary profession. In addition, it says something about the uncomfortable relationship between nonhuman animals and modern notions of literary character.</p><p>This book deals with a period of literary history&#x2014;the fifteenth to the seventeenth centuries&#x2014;that substantially predates <i>Animal Farm</i>. Still, one way to understand Orwell's novel is to place it within the European tradition of beast fable, poetry, and prose narrative that stretches back to Aesop and encompasses works directly germane to the present study: for example, the <i>Roman de Renart</i> (twelfth and thirteenth centuries), Chaucer's Nun's Priest's Tale (1396-1400), Skelton's "Speke, Parrot" (c. 1525), and the fables of La Fontaine (1668). However, this tradition has largely gone fallow over the past two centuries, with the result that modern literary works foregrounding animal subjectivity usually tend to be marginalized as genre fiction: for instance, children's literature (<i>The Wind in the Willows</i>, <i>Winnie the Pooh</i>) or fantasy (<i>His Dark Materials</i>, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>). It is in this general spirit that Dial's reader understood and dismissed Orwell's novel as an animal story. Granted, one may also make sense of modern works dealing with animal characters by classifying them as exercises in allegory or surrealism or experimental fiction (Kafka's "Report to an Academy" and "Investigations of a Dog" come to mind). Indeed, the real failure of the reader for Dial Press is that she misidentified a work we tend to locate in the latter of these categories (allegorical and experimental) as belonging to the former (naive genre fiction). However, even literary works in the second category end up outside the literary mainstream, defined either as retrograde (for example, allegory) or idiosyncratic (for example, experimental fiction). In any case, what Dial Press called "animal stories" seem to require a special dispensation for their continued existence in the modern literary world. They stand as deviations from the norm, to be tolerated rather than encouraged.</p><p>John Ruskin offers us a way of understanding this development when he introduces his notion of the pathetic fallacy in <i>Modern Painters</i> (1843). For Ruskin, the pathetic fallacy is "always the sign of a morbid state of mind" (368) while also managing to be "eminently characteristic of the modern mind" (369)&#x2014;observations that, taken together, lead inevitably to a debased and pathological view of modernity. Indeed, the pathetic fallacy's fallaciousness and its morbidity consist in the very same thing: "a falseness in . . . our impressions of external things," which results from "a mind and body . . . too weak to deal fully with what is before them" (364, 365) and which invests the natural world with the observer's own passions. Weakness of temperament (we might say weakness of character) generates the error, which leads the afflicted individual to invest brute nature with emotions she experiences but which, by virtue of its very brutishness, nature cannot share. The self is so overwhelmed with itself that it imprints itself on the rest of the world.</p><p>Ruskin's examples of this phenomenon are all drawn carefully from nonsentient nature: shivering crocuses, dancing leaves, "raging waves," "remorseless floods," "ravenous billows," and so forth (367). However, a moment's reflection shows that nonhuman animals may serve as a marginal case of the same mental event: their obvious ability to react to their surroundings complicates matters since it supplies proof of sentience, but their inner life&#x2014;their susceptibility to what we might call human passion&#x2014;remains inscrutable. So what does one do with raging lions or timorous lambs, with stubborn mules or proud peacocks, or with any of the innumerable other commonplaces whereby traditional language assumes a continuity between human and nonhuman animal experience? What, in the broader sense, does one do with the impulse to think of nonhuman animals as subjects&#x2014;as characters&#x2014;in their own right?</p><p>From the standpoint of the pathetic fallacy, one must concede that this impulse looks suspicious. Even granting that nonhuman animals are in some sense aware, we remain a long way indeed from endowing them with the mental and emotional furniture of human experience. To do so&#x2014;especially in light of our proved tendency to extend this endowment to rocks and trees and other nonsentient natural entities&#x2014;looks very much like a first step in the direction of sentimental anthropomorphism. In this respect, to allow that animals are more like us than like stones seems to entail a rich panoply of cultural silliness, ranging from pet cemeteries to childish fantasies about talking pigs. Indeed, when considered from the standpoint of the pathetic fallacy, animals appear particularly noxious. They are, as it were, the thin end of the wedge.</p><p>Humanity, Modernity, Character</p><p>Ruskin's work brings pressure to bear on the notion of modernity, which he considers especially susceptible to the silliness at the heart of the pathetic fallacy. The following pages, by contrast, focus on animal character in the <i>early</i> modern period, for it is the span from about 1400 to about 1700 that witnesses the birth of the intellectual dispensation Ruskin takes for granted. At heart, one could describe the present book as a set of interrelated zooliterary histories, or perhaps less pretentiously, as a series of character studies of early modern animals. It concentrates on animal character, in turn, because I consider this crucial to the development of notions of literary character in general. My underlying argument here is simple: that the problem of literary character may best be understood from the standpoint of animal studies, as an instance of broader philosophical and scientific problems in theorizing the human-animal divide.</p><p>That the concept of literary character is a problem&#x2014;or at least entails problems&#x2014;I take as axiomatic. It was certainly so for L. C. Knights when, in 1933, he published his classic essay "How Many Children Had Lady Macbeth?" A brief for New Critical formalism, Knights's article also mounts an attack on the methods of character analysis that dominated earlier critical practice as exemplified by the study of Shakespeare: "The habit of regarding Shakespeare's persons as 'friends for life,' or, maybe, 'deceased acquaintances,' is responsible for most of the vagaries that serve as Shakespeare criticism. . . . It is responsible for all the irrelevant moral and realistic canons that have been applied to Shakespeare's plays, for the sentimentalizing of his heroes (Coleridge and Goethe on Hamlet) and his heroines. And the loss is incalculable" (30). Knights's critique has produced a kind of queasy ambivalence in more recent literary criticism, which remains attached to the notion of character without really wanting to be; as Elizabeth Fowler summarized matters in 2003, "Literary scholarship . . . speaks of characters as if they were real people and, just as frequently, warns us that they are not" (5). The resulting dilemma receives fine comic expression at the hands of David Lodge, an author with credentials both as a theorist and as a writer of fiction. In the 1988 academic novel <i>Nice Work</i>, Lodge's narrator is awkwardly obliged to introduce a character who "doesn't herself believe in the concept of 'character'"&#x2014;one "Robyn Penrose, Temporary Lecturer in English Literature at the University of Rummidge" (21). Penrose's objections to the concept&#x2014;that is, "that 'character' is a bourgeois myth, an illusion created to reinforce the ideology of capitalism," obscuring the crucial insight that "[t]here are no selves, only production, and we produce our 'selves' in language" (21-22)&#x2014;attest to the role of Marxist and postmodernist theory in assailing the legitimacy of character as a literary construct.</p><p>However, the Marxist-postmodernist critique of literary character did not develop in a vacuum; it runs parallel to a broader assault on the category of the human. This broader line of argument is typified by the poststructuralist tradition in current animal-studies theory, which objects to the Benthamite and Kantian schools of animal-rights philosophy, represented by Peter Singer and Tom Regan respectively, on the grounds that these seek to protect nonhuman animals by extending to them a notion of human rights (or in Singer's case, human ethical subjectivity) that is intellectually untenable. Thus, Derrida refuses "to assign, interpret, or project" meaning onto the animal other (this being, I take it, the impulse of traditional animal-rights theory) while likewise resisting the Cartesian reflex to "suspend . . . one's compassion and . . . depriv[e] the animal of every power of manifestation" (387). Gilles Deleuze and Fï¿½lix Guattari replace the notion of being with one of becoming, located in "an objective zone of indetermination or uncertainty . . . 'that makes it impossible to say where the boundary between the human and animal lies'" (273). Giorgio Agamben, arguing that "[i]n our culture, the decisive political conflict . . . is that between the animality and the humanity <i>of man</i>," concludes that "what is decisive here is only the 'between,' the interval . . . between the two terms, their immediate constellation in a non-coincidence" (80, 83; my italics). Each of these positions assumes that to ground political or ethical action on notions of the human is to perpetuate the very inequities that politics and ethics are intended to remedy; hence the deconstruction of the human emerges as a philosophical imperative.</p><p>There can be no doubt that literary criticism's discomfort with the concept of character is related to this growing theoretical impulse to deconstruct the human-animal divide. After all, if a given philosophical category (the human) proves defective, it follows that the category's major literary manifestation (character) should share in its inadequacies. In what follows, I argue that the notion of character develops in English writing as an early effort to evade this very philosophical crisis: as a means of manufacturing and perpetuating the distinction between people and animals.</p><p>This is not how the turn to character and character criticism has usually been understood. Knights explains it in classic New Critical fashion, as a failure of linguistic engagement&#x2014;in the case of Shakespeare scholars, "an inability to appreciate the Elizabethan idiom and a consequent inability to discuss Shakespeare's plays as poetry" (26). Lodge's Robyn Penrose, for her part, follows the Brechtian aperï¿½u that literary illusionism aims to transform audiences into "the passive consumer[s] of a finished, unchangeable art-object offered to them as 'real'" (Eagleton 64); thus, for her, "the rise of the novel (the literary genre of 'character' <i>par excellence</i>) in the eighteenth century coincided with the rise of capitalism" and its endless search for pliable markets (21). For scholars following Ian Watt, the rise of literary character derives from the eighteenth-century tendency to "pa[y] greater attention to the particular individual than had been common before" (Watt 18), a tendency deriving from the philosophical skepticism of figures such as Descartes, Locke, and Hume. While these narratives trace the ascendancy of literary character to different historical events (the development of new language practices, the birth of capitalism, the rise of scientific empiricism), they agree by locating it in the eighteenth century and identifying the novel as its exemplary genre.</p><p>Still, if one takes at face value the eighteenth-century passion for Shakespeare as a creator of characters, it challenges both the chronological focus on the eighteenth century and the generic focus on prose fiction. In any case, as Fowler's recent work with Chaucer has shown, it is patently silly to suppose that pre-Enlightenment authors had no literary characters, if one defines these simply&#x2014;in Fowler's preferred way&#x2014;as "social persons" (27). Moreover, even the term "character," as applied to the "description, delineation, or detailed report of a person's qualities" (<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> [hereafter <i>OED</i>], s.v. "character," sb. 14), predates the eighteenth century. The <i>OED</i>'s earliest recorded instance of this usage comes from James Howell's Letters of 1645, but even this is unfairly belated; with the publication of Joseph Hall's Theophrastan <i>Characters</i> in 1608, the English already possessed a fully formed literary exemplar of the definition. Indeed, Theophrastus's works play a central role in establishing the noun "character" as an English literary term, and in the process they reveal the word's embeddedness in an ancient tradition of philosophical meditation on the nature of human identity.</p><p>Theophrastus is best remembered for treatises in the fields we would now call biology and psychology. These works span the disciplinary divide&#x2014;between "the representation of nonhumans" and "the representation of citizens" (Latour 28)&#x2014;that Bruno Latour identifies with modernity's "separation of natural and political powers" (13). In this regard, they preserve the cross-disciplinary focus of Theophrastus's master, Aristotle, whom he succeeded in 322 B.C.E. as head of the Peripatetic school in Athens. Indeed, if readers of Theophrastus have detected a "botanical" impulse in his <i>Characters</i> (Boyce 5), that is because Theophrastus was working squarely within an Aristotelian tradition in which "[t]he methodical treatment of <i>poiesis</i> in the <i>Poetics</i> is similar to the orderly classification of the body in the <i>History of Animals</i>" (Craik 158). In this tradition the study of rhetoric and the study of natural history, the study of people and the study of animals emerge as parallel expressions of the same taxonomic impulse.</p><p>It may be objected that this is merely a matter of form, that in substance the two undertakings differ considerably. Perhaps, but the most recent translators of Theophrastus's <i>Characters</i> have traced its antecedents back to the lengthiest surviving verse fragment by Semonides of Am...</p></p><h2>Women at Play: The Story of Women in Baseball/ a Harvest Original</h2><p>A comprehensive history of women in baseball chronicles the role of women in the sport from the game&#39;s inception in 1869 to the present. By the author of She&#39;s on First. Original. 12,500 first printing.</p><p>Women's baseball did not begin--and certainly didn't end--with the 1940s short-skirted stars featured in the rousing film story <i>A League of Their Own</i>. Women were playing baseball at Vassar as early as the 1880s, and Ed Barrow, who would later bring Babe Ruth to New York, signed a woman pitcher named Lizzie Arlington to a minor-league contract in the late 1890s. Indeed, as presented here, the history of women in baseball is a long and colorful one; the exploits of Alta Weiss, Lizzie Murphy, and Jackie Mitchell, who struck out Ruth and Lou Gehrig back-to-back in a 1931 exhibition deserve to be remembered. <i>Women at Play</i> remembers well.The 12-year existence of the All-American Girls Baseball League, as depicted in last summer's hit movie A League of Their Own , is only the culmination of a long history of women being paid for playing baseball (not softball). Did you know that hundreds of "bloomer teams" barnstormed the East and Midwest from the 1890s to 1935, playing against men's teams? Or that a few women played American Legion and minor league ball until the organizations officially banned women? Or that in a 1931 exhibition game, Jackie Mitchell, age 17, struck out Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth? Gregorich, author of the woman-plays-pro-ball novel She's on First ( LJ 1/5/87), here focuses on personalities and teams, relying on newspaper accounts and teammates' reminiscences. Women loving baseball and struggling to leap men's roadblocks are the themes of this attractive and unique book.

Starved, shot and beaten, many of the 2,146 prisoners of the Los Baï¿½os prison camp in the Philippines&#x2014;most of them American men, women and children&#x2014;would not survive much longer unless rescued soon.</p><p>Deeply concerned about the half-starved and ill-treated prisoners, General Douglas MacArthur assigned to the 11th Airborne Division a dangerous rescue mission deep behind enemy lines that became a deadly race against the clock. The Los Baï¿½os raid would become one of the greatest triumphs of that war or any war; hailed years later by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell: &#x201c;I doubt that any airborne unit in the world will ever be able to rival the Los Baï¿½os prison raid. It is the textbook operation for all ages and all armies.&#x201d;</p><p>Combining personal interviews, diaries, correspondence, memoirs, and archival research, <em>Rescue at Los Baï¿½os</em> tells the story of a remarkable group of prisoners&#x2014;whose courage and fortitude helped them overcome hardship, deprivation, and cruelty&#x2014;and of the young American soldiers and Filipino guerrillas who risked their lives to save them.</p></p><p><p> Rescue at Los Baï¿½os is the spellbinding survival story of more than two thousand American and Allied civilian prisoners of war&#x2014;men, women, and children&#x2014;held in the Philippines by the Japanese during World War II, and the elite 11th Airborne Division&#x2019;s heart-pounding mission in a race against the clock to rescue them from behind enemy lines</p><p></p><p> As U.S. victory in the Pacific drew near, Japanese soldiers at the Los Baï¿½os Internment Camp became increasingly sadistic and began systematically starving, beating, and killing their captives. Fearing the loss of more innocent lives, General Douglas MacArthur gave the 11th Airborne Division the dangerous mission of freeing these beleaguered men, women, and children in a deadly race against the clock. Rescue at Los Baï¿½os deftly weaves together dramatic accounts of the prison camp with detailed analysis of the complex military operation being planned and carried out, documenting the incredible story of the prisoners and those who risked their lives to save them.</p><p></p><p>Bruce Henderson has written more than twenty books, including the national bestseller <em>Hero Found</em> and <em>Rescue at Los Baï¿½os</em>.

He&#x2019;d seen it crossing a bay south of the island where I grew up and still occasionally reside.<br><br>&#x201c;How far south?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A ways. We were flying back from Key West.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s where you disappeared to?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been traveling,&#x201d; he said, which was typical. &#x201c;It was a Burmese python&#x2014;twelve, maybe fifteen feet long. Too big for a boa. Hard to be sure of the size because it was swimming, but that&#x2019;s not the point.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is to me,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re trying to scare me into moving closer to your lab, I&#x2019;m flattered, but I&#x2019;d prefer the particulars first. There are better ways than inventing snakes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Invent?&#x201d; He was mystified. Marion has warmth, if you get to know him, but he is slow to recognize playful humor.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t doubt you saw it, but there&#x2019;s a hundred miles of coast between here and the Keys. Was the snake closer to Naples or Sanibel Island?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let me finish. I was making a connection between the parasites killing your orange trees and higher-profile exotics like pythons, boas, a whole long list of reptiles that are taking over the state. Not just reptiles, of course. Fire ants have all but destroyed the quail population. Brazilian pepper trees are another example, but they were intentionally introduced by state biologists, so&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Marion,&#x201d; I said patiently, &#x201c;you know I&#x2019;m not fond of snakes, and you know why. Please stick to the subject.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought I was.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You were for a while. Now you&#x2019;re not.&#x201d;<br><br>I was aboard a tidy Marlow cabin cruiser that is my home, neatening up the galley, with the phone to my ear. As we talked, I could look out the cabin door and see the family dock built by my late Uncle Jake as it wobbled through the mangroves. Across the road, atop an Indian mound, was an old yellow-pine Cracker house with a tin roof and a wraparound porch. Veiled by screening were ceiling fans, a summer kitchen, and a hammock where, as a child, I had often slept on hot summer nights.<br><br>What I chose not to notice was a black Lincoln Town Car parked in the shade. For more than an hour, I&#x2019;d been trying to ignore the thing. It belonged to an old-time Florida millionaire who, twenty years ago, had been my mother&#x2019;s secret lover. Two brain surgeries and a fondness for smoking pot have not improved her memory, nor pacified her mood swings and sometimes wild behavior.<br><br>Better, I&#x2019;d decided, to call a friend rather than fixate on what might be going on up there. Inside, it was just the two of them: my mother, Loretta, and eighty-year-old Harney Chatham, the former lieutenant governor of Florida, who was also a married man.<br><br>Not that anyone remembers lieutenant governors. Even Mr. Chatham&#x2019;s recent prostate surgery had not made the news.<br><br>Ford asked, &#x201c;Are you still there?&#x201d;<br><br>I realized my attention had drifted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not one to interrupt, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m not listening. How big was the snake?&#x201d;<br><br>Apparently, he had already covered that ground. Instead of sighing, as a normal person would, he calmly repeated the ï¿½details&#x2014;a quality that was admirable, I suppose, but also rankled me. It was as if he were a professor tutoring one of his slower students.<br><br>&#x201c;Hannah,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t heard from you in more than three weeks&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You disappeared a month ago, so what do you expect?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t disappear, I was traveling,&#x201d; he reminded me. &#x201c;Now, out of the blue, you call to tell me the oranges in your citrus grove are dying. Why ask me for advice?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re <i>withering</i>,&#x201d; I corrected, &#x201c;with a sort of green mold on the skins, and the fruit&#x2019;s bitter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The entire grove?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The ones I care about. The honeybells and grapefruit, all my favorites. You can tell by the leaves. They start to curl up, with yellow streaks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But not all?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think to check.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You should. If some of the trees aren&#x2019;t infected, I&#x2019;d step back&nbsp;and ask myself what&#x2019;s different about them? Less shade, more sun&#x2014;a different soil or rootstock? But if the entire grove is ï¿½diseased&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>I said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not big enough to be called a grove; not really. Just a few dozen trees my grandfather planted way, way back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know. All I&#x2019;m saying is, you must have ties to people in the citrus business who can give you better advice than me.&#x201d;<br><br>Again, my eyes moved to the black limousine. &#x201c;Some of the biggest,&#x201d; I replied, &#x201c;but I do miss our talks. You&#x2019;re a biologist, and it&#x2019;s been a while, so I thought maybe you&#x2019;d heard something new.&#x201d;<br><br>This, he found humorous. &#x201c;The parasites that spread citrus greening don&#x2019;t have fins, and they don&#x2019;t swim. I&#x2019;m a <i>marine </i>biologist. All I know is, they&#x2019;re exotics, and they&#x2019;ve damn near ruined a billion-dollar industry. Is that really the reason you called?&#x201d;<br><br>I was about to cover my deception by shifting topics when I saw Loretta charge out of the house wearing a housecoat and fluffy pink slippers. Her mannerisms were frantic as if she were being chased, or had suffered a second brain aneurysm. She bounced on her toes and flapped her hands in my direction, then charged back onto the porch.<br><br>&#x201c;Something&#x2019;s wrong,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing we can&#x2019;t fix, Hannah, if you&#x2019;re willing to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not us, my crazy mother,&#x201d; I interrupted, and went out the cabin door in a hurry.<br><br>The former lieutenant governor was either dead or in a bad way. I knew it when Loretta blocked me from the porch, saying, &#x201c;Even as a child you had a selfish streak. Now you refuse to do me this one little favor?&#x201d;<br><br>The favor she had demanded was, &#x201c;Go away, and, for god&#x2019;s sake, don&#x2019;t call the law. It&#x2019;s too late to save your mama from ï¿½sinning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But you didn&#x2019;t hear that from me. I&#x2019;m not gonna confess to anything.&#x201d;<br><br>I felt a little dizzy when I heard those words. &#x201c;Where is he, Loretta?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think I recognize his car? If Mr. Chatham is sick, we need to do something. Please tell me something terrible hasn&#x2019;t happened.&#x201d;<br><br>She stared at the Lincoln Town Car and hyperventilated.<br><br>&#x201c;Loretta, move. If Reggie&#x2019;s sleeping in the backseat, go bang on the window and get him up here. I&#x2019;ll look for myself.&#x201d;<br><br>Reggie was Mr. Chatham&#x2019;s limo driver.<br><br>&#x201c;Not until I think this through,&#x201d; she snapped, and squared herself in front of the door. Loretta isn&#x2019;t a large woman&#x2014;not compared to me, her only child&#x2014;but she has a magic way of puffing herself while her bright blue eyes catch fire. &#x201c;For once in your life, do something to make me happy, Hannah. Just go away and leave us be.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not leaving until&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do as you&#x2019;re told, young lady!&#x201d; she hollered, and glared with those wild eyes of hers.<br><br>For an instant, I was a child again, standing in the same doorway of the same house that hadn&#x2019;t changed much since my mother had stung me with similar words many times, over many years. But that girl was long gone, along with her timid nature. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t move, I&#x2019;ll go &#x2019;round to the back door. Or pick you up and carry you to the couch. Is that what you want? The two of us wrestling around like crazy people while we could be helping?&#x201d; Then I called over the top of her head, &#x201c;Mr. Chatham! Everything okay in there? It&#x2019;s me, Hannah Smith.&#x201d;<br><br>On the mantel above the fireplace is a cherrywood clock my great-grandfather made when he wasn&#x2019;t fishing mullet, or selling rum and egret plumes. The clock&#x2019;s ticking was the only reply.<br><br>&#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; I murmured. &#x201c;Loretta, talk to me. Please tell me you did not do something crazy. You didn&#x2019;t stab him, did you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stab him! &#x2019;Course I didn&#x2019;t. In my own bed? What do you think I am?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; I said again. &#x201c;Is that where he is?&#x201d;<br><br>With a dazed look, she turned toward the hall, her bedroom beyond, then appeared to wilt and stepped away. &#x201c;When the law comes, I suppose you&#x2019;ll tell them the governor ain&#x2019;t the first man I killed.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Kilt</i> is the way the word is pronounced in the small fishing communities of Southwest Florida.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s <i>dead</i>?<i>&#x201d;</i><br><br>&#x201c;I believe he is,&#x201d; was her cryptic reply, &#x201c;but Harney&#x2019;s not the type to give up all at once.&#x201d; She began to sob.<br><br>I rushed into the house to where Loretta&#x2019;s recliner faced the TV, which wasn&#x2019;t blaring soap operas for a change. Nearby was her walker. It was covered with a caftan as a vanity. Aside from confiding to a few women friends, she won&#x2019;t admit she needs help getting around, not even to our handsome UPS man, let alone a former lover. I slid the walker within reach and hurried down the&nbsp;hall, calling the governor&#x2019;s name.<br><br>The door to my old room was open, nothing I recognized on the walls or desk. Loretta&#x2019;s door was shut tight, which was normal. As always, I could feel the privacy of shadows and forbidden drawers radiating from within. Twice I knocked, then bumped the door open. After a look, I hollered, &#x201c;Call nine-one-one. Hurry!&#x201d; but didn&#x2019;t budge for a moment because my legs felt watery, like in a bad dream.<br><br>In life, Mr. Chatham was an imposing man with oversized accomplishments. He favored Western-cut suits, string bolo ties, and the only time he removed his hat was when entering a house, or greeting a lady, or before sliding into the back of his limo.<br><br>His cowboy hat&#x2014;&#x201c;my John Wayne Stetson,&#x201d; he called it&#x2014;was the only reason I knew for certain the man who lay there, toes up and naked with vomit crusted on his chin, was the former lieutenant governor. My mother, despite her panic, had had the good manners to place the hat strategically over his pelvis. The Stetson tilted, as if on a peg, the man&#x2019;s two long, heavy legs sticking out. I charged in and did what I&#x2019;d been taught in a CPR course I had to take when I&#x2019;d upgraded my captain&#x2019;s license. Mr. Chatham&#x2019;s neck was as white and cool as clay when I felt for a pulse. Glassy eyes failed to respond to my shouting, nor when I hammered a fist on his chest.<br><br>Next step: clear the airway, then begin mouth-to-mouth. Practicing on a CPR dummy had not prepared me for the realities involved. But I did as I&#x2019;d been taught. Billowed two breaths into his lungs, then shouted out the compressions in a robotic way while I pumped his chest. This helped stem a blooming nausea.<br><br>&#x201c;Mama&#x2014;you&#x2019;d best be dialing that damn phone! Carry it outside while you talk, and bring Reggie fast as you can.&#x201d;<br><br>There was no need to add this because the chauffeur was suddenly beside me, hands on my shoulders, and cooing in his gentle Southern way. &#x201c;You done what you could, Miz Hannah. Go on now, girl, an&#x2019; leave the rest to me.&#x201d;<br><br>I stepped back and brushed hair from my face. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got no pulse. Did Loretta call nine-one-one?&#x201d;<br><br>Reggie, a tiny, wiry man, was wearing the same blue cap he always wore. &#x201c;All taken care of,&#x201d; he said. Then he removed his driving gloves and yelled, &#x201c;Governor! Wake up, sir. This is ain&#x2019;t no place for this to be happening.&#x201d;<br><br>He plopped down, grabbed the man who&#x2019;d been his employer for decades, shook him by the shoulders, and looked up at me with wide eyes. &#x201c;Lord God, he&#x2019;s cold as death, Miz Hannah. His heart done stopped. I knew this was gonna happen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be sure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cold as he is? Honey, he&#x2019;s been gone a while.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We have to keep doing compressions until&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, I know,&#x201d; the little man said, yet sounded resigned. &#x201c;I took that course for my chauffeur&#x2019;s license, but the governor wouldn&#x2019;t like it, you seeing what I gotta do first.&#x201d; He glanced at the Stetson, as if to convey his meaning, then hunched his back and continued CPR. Between breaths he told me, &#x201c;Leave us alone, girl. It&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;d want.&#x201d;<br><br>I was duty-bound to stay but suddenly in need of air. In the bathroom, I left the water running to cover the sound of my nausea, then washed my face and went searching for my mother. She was on the porch, rocking and staring past the mangroves that fringe our dock. It was a cool, bright afternoon in February, with the sky too low for soaring gulls and frigate birds. When I covered her legs with a blanket, she spoke in a monotone. &#x201c;No need to badger me, I know it&#x2019;s my fault. He warned me often enough.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t fret about that now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m being punished for doin&#x2019; what I knew I shouldn&#x2019;t do. I, by god, deserve whatever hell has to offer, &#x2019;cause that&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m headed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say such things. Do you mean Mr. Chatham mentioned he had heart problems? I think that&#x2019;s what happened. He had a heart attack.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t him who warned me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Never mind. The governor&#x2019;s problems always started way south of his heart. We was both that way, God help us. That&#x2019;s why he had that thingamabob installed. I knew we was playing with fire but couldn&#x2019;t stop myself.&#x201d;<br><br>Rather than endure further details, I offered to make a pitcher of sweet tea. My mother rocked and stared.<br><br>&#x201c;Earthly pleasures are a trap, Hannah. Chastity might seem its own punishment&#x2014;until you accept a man from the spirit world. That&#x2019;s when our behavior is supposed to change. Oh, I knew what I was doing.&#x201d;<br><br>There is often no making sense of her babbling. I hugged my mother close as she cried, her shoulders bird-like. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call the home health nurse and have her come early. Or would you rather I have the ladies come keep you company?&#x201d;<br><br>I was referring to Loretta&#x2019;s friends from childhood, Epsey Hendry, Becky Darwin, and Jody Summerlin&#x2014;all widows. Once a week, they would gather on the porch, with cookies, or a&nbsp;pie or brownies, and wait for the church shuttle to carry them to bingo.<br><br>There would be no bingo on this Friday night.<br><br>I gave her another hug, called Becky Darwin without explaining why she was needed, then went inside to check on Reggie. In the hall, I stopped out of respect. He was weeping, but in an angry way, and speaking in low tones to his former employer.&nbsp;Eavesdropping is not something I normally do, yet what I heard was so unexpected, I found myself drawn toward the open door.<br><br>I heard the chauffeur mutter, &#x201c;Where the hell is the damn shutoff valve? I ain&#x2019;t gettin&#x2019; paid to put my hands on your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no, I ain&#x2019;t. I warned you, Governor&#x2014;by god, I warned you&#x2014;now here we are. And who gonna explain this to that bitch you married if I can&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ? Shit fire! How&#x2019;s this damn contraption work?&#x201d;<br></i></p><h2>Man Without a Gun : One Diplomat&#39;s Secret Struggle to Free the Hostages, Fight Terrorism, and End a War</h2><p>Can an unarmed man triumph in a land of terror and violence?<br><br><b>Man Without a Gun</b> is the true story of a single UN diplomat's astonishing high-wire struggle for peace in the Middle East. UN secretary-general Javier Pï¿½rez de Cuï¿½llar called the author "more of a soldier than a diplomat." And, indeed, his life is the stuff of John le Carrï¿½ thrillers. But Man Without a Gun is more than a thriller: It is a real-life voyage through the maze of the secretive Middle East, the inside account of the political maneuverings that continue to dominate today's headlines, and the moving story of one man's struggle to bring some hope to a violent land.<br><br>In more than two decades, Giandomenico Picco negotiated an end to wars in Afghanistan and between Iran and Iraq with the force of his decency and the strength of the UN. But little could prepare Picco for the danger he would face in resolving the Lebanon hostage crisis. Negotiating with terrorists was not a matter of meeting gray men in gray suits in well-appointed offices. Picco worked on the ground, alone. He was taken to meet the hostage takers themselves many times, shrouded in a black hood, racing through the darkened streets of Lebanon as masked gunmen barked orders.<br><br>His life was at risk, but he was well aware that the lives of dozens of hostages, including Terry Anderson and Terry Waite, were at greater risk. And saving them meant negotiating face-to-face--Picco first had to win the trust of the Islamic mili-<br>tant leader who had taken them, a well-spoken, hooded man known to Picco only by the nom de guerre "Abdullah."<br><br>The details of Picco's secret negotiations have never before been revealed; until now, it was barely even known who the kidnappers were. As the chief UN hostage negotiator, Picco often had to make split-second, life-or-death decisions based on the promise of a masked informant or an anonymous official. Yet on the strength of his own word, he managed to forge an unlikely coalition among Iran, Syria, Israel, and the Lebanese groups to win the release of the captives. <br><br>"History does not kill," writes Picco. "Religion does not rape women, the purity of blood does not destroy buildings, and institutions do not fail. Only individuals do these things." Man Without a Gun is this remarkable diplomat's powerful testimony to the ability of individuals also to bring some peace to a troubled world.</p><p><i>Man Without a Gun</i> is a thrilling memoir of Giandomenico Picco's two decades as a high-level diplomat for the United Nations. Over the course of his career, Picco helped negotiate the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and helped bring an end to the bloody Iran-Iraq war, but he also had several harrowing encounters with Middle Eastern terrorists--whom he met unarmed. In one memorable episode, he walked out of an embassy in Beirut and was grabbed on the street, thrown into a car with his face jammed to the floor, and whisked to a secret location to discuss the release of Western hostages with their masked captors. Other experiences are equally unnerving, such as a trip to Tehran to share unwelcome news with Iranian president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani: the United States had just refused to reciprocate an act of goodwill (the release of hostage Terry Anderson). Picco wondered whether he would get out of the country alive; he did, but only because Rafsanjani offered this advice: "I think it is best if you leave Tehran very, very quickly." <p> "History does not kill," Picco writes of what his experiences have taught him. "Religion does not rape women, the purity of blood does not destroy buildings, and institutions do not fail. Only individuals do these things." <i>Man Without a Gun</i> is at turns wise and exciting--a wonderful and revealing account of modern diplomacy. <i>--John J.

As a boy in Italy, where he was born in 1913, his first toys included the hand wood working tools which surrounded him daily in his family&#39;s shop, where fine originalfurniture was designed and crafted by hand. This inheritance, plus many years of experience and experiment, has enabled Mario Dal Fabbro to design and execute furniture of rare functional grace and symmetry. At the same time,because of technical superiority, his furniture does not sacrifice any of the strength and durability usually associated with more ponderous pieces. Between 1938 and 1948 , Mr. Dal Fabbro became widely recognized abroad as an imprtant exponent of creative contemporary furniture design. His output was prodigious; he designed hundreds of pieces for private individuals and for renowned Milan furniture houses. Many of his designs were acclaimed at international furniture exhibitions and competitions. He also found time to write several books on furniture design and construction which were published in Milan by Hoepli and Goelich. Mario Dal Fabbro came to the United States in 1948 and now designs furniture for American manufacturers. Since coming here he has written a number of furniture boks including the very popular How To Make Built-In Furniture. He is also a contributor to the do-it-yourself pages of many newspapers and magazines, including The New York Times and House and Garden.

In New York City, you&#39;re much more likely to fall down a manhole than a rabbit hole and, if you do, you&#39;re not going to find a tea party. What you might find...? Collins&#39;s musings led to the creation of The Underland Chronicles. &#34;I liked the fact that this world was teeming under New York City and nobody was aware of it. That you could be going along preoccupied with your own problems and then whoosh! You take a wrong turn in your laundry room and suddenly a giant cockroach is right in your face.

Nowadays food is &#39;manufactured&#39;, imported and marketed for convenience and all-year round availability. As well as losing the link between growing and eating, we have also lost quality and taste- it&#39;s not hard to see why asparagus grown at home tastes better than asparagus that has travelled 2000 miles to reach your table. This book returns to the value of real food, and shows both practical gardening and cookery techniques together with 40 recipes.

Both memoirs were written while the authors were still in hiding, unsure if they would succeed in evading the Nazis. Srul Cymlich&#39;s memoir is one of a handful of Jewish accounts of the Treblinka I forced labor camp. It provides a rare insight into the brutal daily life he and other inmates endured. Srul escaped in April 1943, just before he was due to be transferred to and murdered in the Treblinka II extermination camp. Oskar Stawczynski&#39;s memoir is one of the earliest written eyewitness accounts of the August 2, 1943 uprising in Treblinka. Strawczynski tells of Jewish camp officials&#39; cruel treatment of their fellow Jewish prisoners; the viciousness of the German staff; preparations for the uprising, and life after the mass escape of the camp. Both men owed their survival and the opportunity to write their stories to their own daring and initiative as well as to the assistance they received from a variety of people, including Polish rescuers. Each wrote in order to tell his tale to the world and to his surviving family members, but at the time of writing neither author knew if he would survive,or if his account would ever be read by anyone.</p><p></p><h2>Nancy Drew 39: The Clue of the Dancing Puppet GB</h2><p>The young detective and her friends probe the mysterious movements of puppets on the Van Pelt estate</p><p>When the eerie performances of a life-size puppet begin to haunt the old Van Pelt estate, where and amateur acting group-The Footlighters-have their theater, Nancy Drew is called upon to unravel the mystery.Carolyn Keene is a pen name used by a variety of authors for the classic Nancy Drew Mystery series.

Moore's classic holiday poem, <em>The Night Before Christmas</em>, but none is cozier or more full of joy than this one, brought to magical life by one of America's most cherished and highly-acclaimed illustrators, the late Tasha Tudor. This special 10th anniversary paperback has a great new look, with a redesigned cover featuring an illustration of a Christmas tree and sparkling gold foil. With crisp snowy landscapes, warm glowing details, and a host of cuddly critters, children (and adults!) will love cuddling up and reading this festive holiday story as they stay up on Christmas Eve, waiting for Santa to come down the chimney.</p><p>Whose tiny faces are peeking out from Santa's golden sleigh? Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations ï¿½1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

She&#39;s frightened enough to move in with Detective John LaMoia, adevelopment that doesn&#39;t exactly thrill Lou Boldt, their boss and Daphne&#39;sex-lover. But Lou&#39;s too busy with his own cases to brood over John and Daphne:the recent disappearances of two local women, and the death of Billy Chen, thenephew of Mama Lu, an old friend and a powerful figure in Seattle&#39;s Chinesecommunity, which appeared to be an accident but turns out to have been murder.The only thing the disappearances and murder have in common is location; allthree victims were last seen in a part of downtown built over the Underground, adark and dangerous warren of buildings abandoned after the fire that leveledSeattle more than a hundred years ago. While Seattle&#39;s Underground has been thesetting for several mysteries by other authors (Earl Emerson, J.A. Jance),Pearson makes the most of its creepy-crawly atmosphere in a gripping thrillerwhose solid plotting pulls all of Daphne&#39;s, LaMoia&#39;s, and Boldt&#39;s casestogether. It also wisely reconfigures the personal relationships among the threecentral characters, which bodes well for their future adventures in thislong-running series (Middle ofNowhere, The PiedPiper). --Jane Adams</p><p>Ridley Pearson is the award-winning co-author, along with Dave Barry, of <em>Peter and the Starcatchers</em>, <em>Peter and the Shadow Thieves</em>, <em>Peter and the Secret of Rundoon</em>, <em>Peter and the Sword of Mercy</em>, <em>Escape From the Carnivale</em>, <em>Cave of the Dark Wind</em>, <em>Blood Tide</em>, and <em>Science Fair</em>.

Smith, roused by the newspaper reports of desecrated Belgium and France, crossed the Canadian border and joined the Wesmount Rifles. After stints with the First Canadian Contingent at Ypres, Festubert, Givenchy, Ploegsteert, and Messines, where he was, according to the original foreword, struck by a piece of shrapnel and removed from combat, Sgt. Smith joined the British-Canadian Recruiting Mission.

Richard Rorty, a Princeton professor who had contributed to the analytic tradition in philosophy, was now attempting to shrug off all the central problems with which it had long been preoccupied. After publication, the Press was barely able to keep up with demand, and the book has since gone on to become one of its all-time best-sellers in philosophy.</p><br><p> Rorty argued that, beginning in the seventeenth century, philosophers developed an unhealthy obsession with the notion of representation. They compared the mind to a mirror that reflects reality. In their view, knowledge is concerned with the accuracy of these reflections, and the strategy employed to obtain this knowledge--that of inspecting, repairing, and polishing the mirror--belongs to philosophy. Rorty's book was a powerful critique of this imagery and the tradition of thought that it spawned. He argued that the questions about truth posed by Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and modern epistemologists and philosophers of language simply couldn&#x2019;t be answered and were, in any case, irrelevant to serious social and cultural inquiry. This stance provoked a barrage of criticism, but whatever the strengths of Rorty&#x2019;s specific claims, the book had a therapeutic effect on philosophy. It reenergized pragmatism as an intellectual force, steered philosophy back to its roots in the humanities, and helped to make alternatives to analytic philosophy a serious choice for young graduate students. Twenty-five years later, the book remains a must-read for anyone seriously concerned about the nature of philosophical inquiry and what philosophers can and cannot do to help us understand and improve the world.</p></p><p>"This is an ambitious and important book. Ambitious because it attempts to place the main concerns and discussions of contemporary philosophy within a historical perspective; important because this is all too rarely attempted within our present philosophical culture, and almost never done this well."

Like his Lebanese immigrant family, the author&#39;s life has been bound in agriculture and writing. Ancient Tillage (1975) and A Cup of Rage (1978), a novella, are his two major literary works. He also worked as a journalist and editor for the newspaper Jornal do Bairro, jointly founded with his brothers. Although an acclaimed literary author, since 1985 Raduan Nassar has led a private existence dedicated to farming and livestock production. He retired to a smaller farm in 2011, having donated his entire commercial property to the agricultural departments of the Federal University of Sï¿½o Carlos for the creation of a new campus.If this country were grown-up enough to have a literary Good Sex award, this explosively erotic story from the Brazilian modernist would be a strong contender... A Cup of Rage is a burning coal of a work, superbly translated by Stefan Tobler....The writing is chewy - dense, tough, but well worth the effort -- Nick Lezard * The Guardian * &#39;How often, honestly, does the unveiling in translation of a &#39;forgotten genius&#39; live up to the hype? Well here&#39;s one that does: Raduan Nassar * Times Literary Supplement * The book contains much: rich inner monologue, political allusions and a mesmerising pull between dominance and insolence in lovers&#39; quarrels -- Sara Wilson * World Literature Today * Raduan Nassar&#39;s work is both rare and transcendent. From the conflict between the couple in &#34;A Cup of Rage&#34; to the return of the prodigal son of an immigrant family in &#34;Ancient Tillage&#34;, Nassar&#39;s narratives are dry, muscular - and when you least expect it, raise flight and achieve uncommonly lyrical plains. His books are like a land manually ploughed in a precise and essential way; there is not a single excessive word in either of them. His language sprouts up with force and expression; every word is an exposed nerve. -- Walter Salles One of the highest points of the Portuguese language of our time -- Folha de S.

You and I have been friends for a long time and I always knew you were born to write romantic suspense. When and how did you figure it out?</p> <p><strong>Elizabeth Lowell:</strong> Like you, I wanted to write romantic suspense for years, but no one wanted to buy it. Then a publisher bought <i>Tell Me No Lies</i>. I was thrilled. The book did well, but the publisher didn&#x2019;t. Eventually I had another opportunity to write romantic suspense. <i>Amber Beach</i> was a New York Times bestseller. After that, it was much easier to sell romantic suspense!</p> <p><strong>JAK: </strong>Your female characters have a real edge. They are strong, competent, sexy, and smart, yet always feminine. Shaye, the lead character in <i>Dangerous Refuge</i>, is a perfect example. As a writer, how do you define feminine and masculine strength? </p> <p><strong>EL:</strong> I believe that male and female are complementary. A strong man can protect a woman. A strong woman allows a man to be gentle. Each brings possibilities to the other; each fulfills needs in the other. Each could live independently but chooses to share life with another. Love is itself an expression of strength.</p> <p><strong>JAK: </strong>You have a rare gift for creating powerful settings. The landscape is always a character in your books.

Something in me needs long views and mountain winds.</p> <p><strong>JAK: </strong>The intrigue in your novels always has an authentic &#x201c;ripped from the headlines&#x201d; feel. I know you do a great deal of research before you sit down to write. What is the &#x201c;real story&#x201d; behind <i>Dangerous Refuge</i>?</p> <p><strong>EL:</strong> <i>Dangerous Refuge</i> isn&#x2019;t based on any &#x201c;real&#x201d; event. The story came from an understanding of how the Intermountain West is caught between the past, when there were few people in a huge land, and the present, when too many people depend on too few resources. Simply put, much of the West lacks water. From that truth comes much friction, intrigue, competition, wealth . . . and death. While the backdrop is very real, the story is pure fiction.</p> <p><strong>JAK:</strong> You used MMA (mixed martial arts) in the plot of <i>Dangerous Refuge</i>. How did you decide that it fit into the premise of this book?</p> <p><strong>EL:</strong> There is a unique grittiness to the sport. Gambling as a plot device is commonplace in Nevada settings. I wanted something different.</p> <p><strong>JAK:</strong> You and I tend to enjoy the same books so I&#x2019;m curious: what are you reading now?</p> <p><strong>EL:</strong> J. D.

Well before the Montgomery bus boycott, mothers led their children into segregated amusement parks, teenagers congregated at forbidden swimming pools, and church groups picnicked at white-only parks. But too often white mobs attacked those who dared to transgress racial norms. In <i>Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters</i>, Victoria W. Wolcott tells the story of this battle for access to leisure space in cities all over the United States.</p><p>Contradicting the nostalgic image of urban leisure venues as democratic spaces, Wolcott reveals that racial segregation was crucial to their appeal. Parks, pools, and playgrounds offered city dwellers room to exercise, relax, and escape urban cares. These gathering spots also gave young people the opportunity to mingle, flirt, and dance. As cities grew more diverse, these social forms of fun prompted white insistence on racially exclusive recreation. Wolcott shows how black activists and ordinary people fought such infringements on their right to access public leisure. In the face of violence and intimidation, they swam at white-only beaches, boycotted discriminatory roller rinks, and picketed Jim Crow amusement parks. When African Americans demanded inclusive public recreational facilities, white consumers abandoned those places. Many parks closed or privatized within a decade of desegregation. Wolcott's book tracks the decline of the urban amusement park and the simultaneous rise of the suburban theme park, reframing these shifts within the civil rights context.</p><p>Filled with detailed accounts and powerful insights, <i>Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters</i> brings to light overlooked aspects of conflicts over public accommodations. This eloquent history demonstrates the significance of leisure in American race relations.</p></p><p>Victoria W. Wolcott is Professor of History at the University at Buffalo, SUNY, and the author of Remaking Respectability: African-American Women in Interwar Detroit.<p>Introduction</p><blockquote>When you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children . . . then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait.<br>&#x2014;Martin Luther King, Jr., "Letter from Birmingham Jail" (1963)<p></p><p>I do not know many Negroes who are eager to be "accepted" by white people, still less to be loved by them; they, the blacks, simply don't wish to be beaten over the head by the whites every instant of our brief passage on this planet.<br>&#x2014;James Baldwin, <i>The Fire Next Time</i></p></blockquote>When Martin Luther King, Jr.'s daughter Yolanda Denise asked her father why she could not go to Funtown, she touched on a painful reality that has been largely forgotten. Across the country, North and South, young African Americans discovered that time-honored discriminatory practices limited their access to amusement parks and other recreational facilities. And when they did approach these spaces they often confronted the white violence invoked by James Baldwin. Blacks wanted freedom and mobility without being "beaten over the head." They sought to live their lives fully as citizens and consumers without the constraints of segregation. Like King, they wished to protect their children from the reality of racism. Blacks desired not to be "loved" by whites but to coexist with them&#x2014;and to use the swimming pools, roller-skating rinks, and Funtowns that made urban life in mid-twentieth-century America pleasurable.<p></p><p>The segregated recreation that the King family encountered in Atlanta was present throughout the country. The problem of segregated amusements was national in scope and the solution required a broad-based movement. African Americans in the twentieth century engaged in just such a movement, not simply for integration but for the occupation of public space in American cities. Among the most coveted urban spaces were those that encouraged young men and women to put aside their daily cares, flirt, and play. This potential for romance, and the association of African Americans with dirt and disorder, led to whites' insistence that recreational spaces be racially homogenous. Owners and managers of amusements constantly reassured their white customers that their facilities were clean and safe places to let loose and mix with the opposite sex. The result was an elaborate system of racial segregation in urban recreation. How African Americans challenged this segregation is the subject of this book.</p><p>Historians have developed a deep understanding of racial discrimination in housing and labor in mid-twentieth-century cities, yet their understanding of recreation remains shallow. Recreational facilities are public accommodations and can appear marginal compared to economic and political structures. Historians who have challenged the "master narrative" of civil rights by expanding their analyses both chronologically and geographically have promoted the primacy of economic and housing issues in the past decade and moved away from the examination of public accommodations. The long civil rights movement now incorporates the class struggles of the Great Depression and the welfare rights and black power movements of the 1970s. Rather than focusing on the conflict between the southern civil rights movement and whites' massive resistance to integration, historians have reached north and west to examine myriad local struggles for racial equality and freedom. Central to these examinations are economic policies, particularly in works that incorporate labor struggles during the Great Depression and World War II. And the civil rights movement's expansion north and west has shifted our attention to discriminatory housing patterns that segregated American cities.</p><p>For historians who focus on political economy, the struggle to open public accommodations is sometimes viewed as legalistic. Some see efforts to desegregate public accommodations as part of an "integrationist framework" that ignores black nationalism and views the 1964 Civil Rights Act as the culmination of the movement. Integration, it has been argued, also undermined black economic power and self-determination. Focusing on public accommodations can also reify the dichotomy of the "innocent" North, where Jim Crow supposedly did not exist, versus the "evil" South, with its system of legal apartheid. Historians of the long civil rights movement reject this dichotomy and demonstrate the culpability of the state in creating and reinforcing patterns of segregation throughout the country. These historians also reject the notion that black power activists' commitment to self-defense undermined nonviolence and interracialism, thus leading to the movement's decline. Instead, they take seriously the broader goals of black nationalism and refuse to elevate nonviolent activists to near saintly positions in the American imagination.</p><p>With these important correctives in mind, is it possible to revisit the struggle to open public accommodations while escaping the "integrationist framework"? I believe it is, but historians must recognize that our view of what constituted civil rights activism cannot be a zero-sum game. Desegregating public accommodations was a goal powerfully desired by African Americans throughout the country. Just because white liberals, who saw integration as the primary goal of racial equality, also embraced this objective does not diminish its centrality in the black freedom movement. Liberal interracialism coexisted with radical interracialism promoted by nonviolent pacifists and ordinary black citizens who demanded immediate change, not the gradual process of moral persuasion promoted by racial liberals. These movements are related but should not be conflated. Therefore, writing public accommodations out of the civil rights narrative, or downplaying it, is a mistake. Rather, we need to rethink the struggle for public accommodations with the insights of the long civil rights movement historiography in mind.</p><p>One way to broaden our understanding of desegregation is by conceiving of it as part of a broader struggle for control of and access to urban space. The segregation of public accommodations denied African Americans their right to occupy the same spaces as whites. They could not act as consumers on an equal basis, and they could not fully inhabit the cities and towns in which they lived. African Americans' demand for the right to use recreation was not simply about integration and interracial friendship but about power and possession. For this reason the struggle for recreational space was not only the purview of southern nonviolent activists but a national movement that included teenagers, mothers, and ordinary consumers who demanded equal access without having to face racial epithets and daily violence. African Americans wanted to participate in all the recreation cities had to offer, and they wished to protect their children from white violence. Violence perpetrated by whites, however, has not been widely recognized as a major factor in maintaining segregation. Popular memories of mid-twentieth-century urban amusements are replete with nostalgia and rarely contain references to segregation. This erasure of white violence has led many to blame the decline of urban recreation on "deviant" behavior by African Americans in newly desegregated amusements.</p><p>The struggle to desegregate public accommodations in the face of white terror did not begin with Rosa Parks's defiant stance in 1954. Even when identifying only activists who employed nonviolent passive resistance to challenge Jim Crow, one has to look at least a decade before the Montgomery bus boycott. The pioneering members of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) carried out a major campaign against Chicago's segregated White City Roller Rink in 1942 and fine-tuned organizing strategies that would prove enormously effective a decade later. And prior to the war years many ordinary African American citizens challenged segregated recreation nationwide, swimming at whites only beaches, boycotting segregated roller rinks, and picketing Jim Crow amusement parks. For most the goal was desegregation, obtaining the right to occupy recreational space, rather than integration, fully sharing facilities with white neighbors. But motivations for engaging in the struggle over recreation varied. Liberal and radical white supporters of desegregation campaigns&#x2014;for example, the white members of CORE who put their bodies on the line to fight for racial equality&#x2014;were more likely to view full integration and interracialism as the goal. Middle-class African Americans often sought the respectability that came with full participation in consumerism. Working-class African Americans frequently conceived of the occupation of public space as a form of community control and a means to protect family members. Together these actors challenged the racial logic that associated white spaces with safety and security.</p><p>Moreover, the struggle for desegregated public accommodations was never fully distinct from the struggle for equal access to housing and employment. A local swimming pool or playground was an extension of a neighborhood, and as the racial composition of neighborhoods changed, urban dwellers contested these spaces. Whites who defended their "rights" to all-white workplaces and communities perhaps best understood this connection. Indeed, there is a relationship between what I term "recreation riots," racial conflicts in spaces of leisure, with housing riots in mid-twentieth-century American cities. Historians have documented hundreds of small-scale and large-scale housing riots in the 1940s and 1950s. In most cases, these were precipitated by an African American family's attempt to move into a white neighborhood, only to be met with angry residents who burned crosses, damaged property, and generally terrorized the newcomers. In the summer of 1951 one such riot in Cicero, an all-white suburb of Chicago, gained national attention as thousands of whites firebombed and gutted an apartment building after a middle-class black family moved in. Many miles away that same summer a white guard at Palisades Park, a New Jersey amusement park across the Hudson River from Manhattan, invoked this housing riot to justify his own threat of racial violence. When a black activist, Ulysses Smith, attempted to enter the Palisades Park pool the guard stopped him and asked whether "he wanted to create an incident such as had occurred in Cicero." In this case the Palisades guard used Cicero as a weapon to intimidate black activists and consumers. Violent attempts to forestall housing integration legitimated violent attempts to forestall recreational integration.</p><p>Two years before Smith approached the Palisades pool, New Jersey passed the Freeman Civil Rights Act in response to pressure from activists. The act specifically named swimming pools as a public accommodation where discrimination was prohibited. But the legal niceties of civil rights legislation had minimal meaning in such confrontations. Instead, it was Smith's willingness to brave the guards and white crowds at the pool that defined the limits and possibilities of desegregation. The law was a major player in the struggle over recreational segregation, but it did not have the power to enforce equal access to public accommodations. Most northern and border states had both civil rights laws and segregated recreational facilities. Some southern communities had no segregation laws mandating separate facilities, and yet blacks had little access to recreation. This complex story undercuts the simplistic binary of southern de jure segregation versus northern de facto segregation. Despite this, many scholars and observers would agree with Randall Kennedy that "Racial discrimination in places of public accommodation was, for the most part, a peculiar feature of southern folkways." This "southern exceptionalism" pervades discussions of public accommodations and reinforces the myth of an innocent North and guilt-ridden South. But even a cursory review of the evidence demonstrates that recreational segregation and the struggle to dismantle it were both national in scope.</p><p>Arguing for a national civil rights narrative and the end to southern exceptionalism does not erase the specific legal and social histories of different localities. White resistance to recreational integration in Birmingham, Alabama, was more profound and violent than white resistance to recreational integration in Buffalo, New York. And specific forms of recreation were more popular in some regions than others. Traditional urban amusement parks, for example, were largely phenomena of the Northeast and Midwest where entrepreneurs built them at the end of trolley lines. Throughout this book I have emphasized the lesser-known stories of northern segregation that have been widely neglected by scholars. To borrow from Jeanne Theoharis, in these cities recreational segregation was "hidden in plain sight." The presence of northern segregation challenges notions of northern innocence and helps us understand the civil rights movement as circulatory, rather than traveling from south to north. Individual activists who led campaigns to open amusement parks in Cleveland and New Jersey during the 1940s and 1950s trained nonviolent activists who challenged segregated accommodations in the South in the early 1960s. In addition, throughout the country ordinary African Americans insisted on their right to access amusements during the postwar period. Some became part of a political movement by filing lawsuits with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) or joining CORE, but many others engaged in daily forms of civil disobedience that were disconnected from civil rights leadership. When teenagers carried out this disobedience most commentators viewed their occupation of public space as juvenile delinquency or crime rather than a demand for racial equality. Throughout this book my focus will be on uncovering these stories on the local level rather than making broad regional generalities. Together these local stories document a national narrative of a mass movement to open recreational facilities to all Americans.</p><p>Although the struggle against segregation was national in scope, African Americans who sought to highlight the pervasiveness of Jim Crow and shame whites who supported it often used the language of regionalism as a tool. For example, in 1921 the African American newspaper <i>Chicago Defender</i> editorialized against beach segregation with the statement "This is not the South, and we refuse to be 'jim-crowed.'" In claiming that Chicago was "not the South" Chicago blacks were demanding that white northerners live up to their reputation as moderate on racial issues. Thus the myth of southern exceptionalism was not an invention of white supremacists alone but mobilized and perpetuated by African Americans to gain racial equality in the North and West. Some whites also used this rhetoric of regionalism to justify segregation. The owners of Coney Island Amusement Park in Cincinnati, for example, argued that their pa...</p></p><h2>The Farm Cooking School: Techniques and Recipes That Celebrate The Seasons</h2><p>When you visit <i>The Farm Cooking School</i>&nbsp;you&#x2019;ll not only leave with a full stomach, but&nbsp;having learned something new.<br><br><i>The&nbsp;Farm Cooking School</i>&nbsp;is packed with many of the same lessons you&#x2019;d learn in person at the school, taught through more than 100 delicious recipes.<br><br> You&#x2019;ll learn how to make the flakiest pie crust for peerless summer pies, use fresh farm eggs for sweet, airy pavlova, and&nbsp;highlight what&#x2019;s growing now&nbsp;with scratch-made pizzas and pastas.

This book explores what the empire meant to its subjects.<br><br>The idea of Rome has long outlived the physical empire that gave it form, and now holds sway over vastly more people and a far greater geographical area than the Romans ever ruled. It continues to shape our understanding of the nature of imperialism, and thus, however subtly, to influence the workings of the world. Unlike most works on Roman history, this book does not offer a simplistic narrative, with military triumph followed by decline and fall. Instead, it analyses the origins and nature of Roman imperialism, its economic, social and cultural impact on the regions it conquered, and its continuing influence in discussions and debates about modern imperialism.</p></p><p><p><b>Neville Morley</b> is Professor of Ancient Economic History &amp; Historical Theory at the University of Bristol.

Reprint.</p><p>Sequel to Sherwood (1991), the versatile Godwin's revisionist historical that recasts Robin Hood as Thane Edward of Denby, a Saxon resister to the invading Normans led by William the Conqueror. This time out, Robin gets all stirred up about peasants' rights and unwisely authors a document recommending limits to the divine rights of kings. Unsurprisingly, he earns the enmity of William's Chancellor, the capable, vicious upstart Ranulf of Bayeux, and annoys William himself. Banished from England and taken in chains to Normandy, Robin saves William's life along the way, and soon become friends with the likable but intemperate Rossel, the future William II. After various feats, Robin is pardoned by a dying William and returns to England--but he has reckoned without the unremitting hostility of Ranulf. Having fallen out with Rossel (peasants' lib again), Robin is accused of witchcraft by Ranulf, found guilty, excommunicated, and condemned to death--and only some last-minute heroics preserve his holding for his son and heir, Edward. Godwin enthusiastically pounds away at the 11th century, but the upshot is a grim, dull, fitful drama, from which any semblance to the legendary Robin Hood and his merrie deeds has long since departed. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Sherwood Forest no longer rings with the daring exploits of Edward "Robin Hood" Denby; now middle-aged, Robin lives contentedly with his beloved Marian and their two children. He's even become friends with the Sheriff of Nottingham, who has married his cousin. In this sequel to Sherwood , Robin gets into trouble again when he argues in court against a plan to convert part of Sherwood into a royal hunting preserve for William I, who rules England from Normandy. Banished for his insolence, Robin becomes a body servant to the king and his second son, the brave, licentious Rossel. He changes the course of English history by convincing William to alter the line of succession, a development that Godwin's spellbinding storytelling makes totally believable. Not just a first-rate adventure, this is also a fascinating account of everyday life in the 11th century, whose customs, beliefs, superstitions and fears are vividly evoked. Witchcraft, intrigue and betrayal lead to a shocking denouement. Deft characterizations, superb battle scenes and more than a little wit make this a worthy addition to Robin Hood lore. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Buck Schiwetz' Memories (Volume 3) (Joe &amp; Betty Moore Texas Art)</h2><p>Buck Schiwetz is best known for his depiction of the Texas scene, and Texas predominates in this volume of eighty works of art, sixty-four of them splendidly reproduced in full color.

When the Irish emigrated to North America, some of the Gentry followed...only to find that the New World already had spirits of its own, called <i>manitou</i> and other such names by the Native tribes.<br><br>Now generations have passed, and the Irish have made homes in the new land, but the Gentry still wander homeless on the city streets. Gathering in the city shadows, they bide their time and dream of power. As their dreams grow harder, darker, fiercer, so do the Gentry themselves--appearing, to those with the sight to see them, as hard and dangerous men, invariably dressed in black.<br><br>Bettina can see the Gentry, and knows them for what they are. Part Indian, part Mexican, she was raised by her grandmother to understand the spirit world. Now she lives in Kellygnow, a massive old house run as an arts colony on the outskirts of Newford, a world away from the Southwestern desert of her youth. Outsider her nighttime window, she often spies the dark men, squatting in the snow, smoking, brooding, waiting. She calls them <i>los lobos</i>, the wolves, and stays clear of them--until the night one follows her to the woods, and takes her hand....<br><br>Ellie, an independent young sculptor, is another with magic in her blood, but she refuses to believe it, even though she, too, sees the dark men. A strange old woman has summoned Ellie to Kellygnow to create a mask for her based on an ancient Celtic artifact. It is the mask of the mythic Summer King--another thing Ellie does not believe in. Yet lack of belief won't dim the power of the mast, or its dreadful intent.<br><br>Donal, Ellie's former lover, comes from an Irish family and knows the truth at the heart of the old myths. He thinks he can use the mask and the "hard men" for his own purposes. And Donal's sister, Miki, a punk accordion player, stands on the other side of the Gentry's battle with the Native spirits of the land. She knows that more than her brother's soul is at stake. All of Newford is threatened, human and mythic beings alike.<br><br>Once again Charles de Lint weaves the mythic traditions of many cultures into a seamless cloth, bringing folklore, music, and unforgettable characters to life on modern city streets.<br><br></p><p><i>Forests of the Heart</i> is an enthralling voyage into the seamier side of urban magic. Returning to the familiar environs of Newford, where he sets so many of his modern myths, Charles de Lint introduces some of his most memorable characters yet.<p> The Gentry are ancient spirits of the land, sired in rape and born of woman in the Old Country. When the Irish immigrated to the New World, some of the Gentry came along. Generations later, having no real ties to their new home, they dream dark dreams of wresting the land surrounding Newford from the native <i>manitou</i> spirits. The Gentry's scheming and plotting draw some of the inhabitants of Newford into a dark and desperate fight against them and a primeval spirit, old as the earth itself but slumbering in <i>la epoca del mito</i>, the myth time.</p><p> Bettina, a <i>curandera</i>--or healer--is part Mexican and part Indian. She has recently moved to Newford from the deserts of the Southwest for reasons she can't understand. She lives in Kellygnow, an art colony perched on a hill overlooking Newford. Earning her keep as a model for the various artists who live and work there, she tries to apply her desert-learned skills and knowledge in the cold, forested surroundings. </p><p> Bettina's fellow Kellygnowians include Nuala, who seems slightly more spiritual than the average housekeeper; Ellie, a sculptor with a very special commission; and the Recluse, a mysterious figure who winters at Kellygnow in one of the outlying private cottages. Donal, an Irish-born malcontent who dreams of better times, joins them, along with Miki, his musician sister, and Tommy, a Native American accompanied by a few of his apparently innumerable aunts. The looming battle against a seemingly invincible foe draws them together and forces them to depend not only upon their skills and powers, but also on hope, trust, and love.</p><p> Blending aspects of different cultural legends and myths with his keen insight into human nature, Charles de Lint offers a truly incredible and compelling tale. His specialty is an intoxicating mix of real and fantasy worlds, and <i>Forests of the Heart</i> delivers a delicious punch. With his deft touch and sensitive style, de Lint's mastery of the urban fantasy tale and his ability as a great storyteller remain unchallenged. <i>--Robert Gately</i></p><br>Born in Holland in 1951, Charles de Lint grew up in Canada, with a few years off in Turkey, Lebanon, and Switzerland. <br><br>Although his first novel was 1984's <i>The Riddle of the Wren</i>, it was with<i> Moonheart</i>, published later that same year, that de Lint made his mark, and established him at the forefront of "urban fantasy," modern fantasy storytelling set on contemporary city streets. <i> Moonheart </i>was set in and around "Newford," an imaginary modern North American city, and many of de Lint's subsequent novels have been set in Newford as well, with a growing cast of characters who weave their way in and out of the stories.

Burroughs </b>(1914-1997) was an American author, painter, and spoken-word performer who has had a wide-ranging influence on American culture. Jack Kerouac called him the "greatest satirical writer since Jonathan Swift." Norman Mailer declared him "the only American writer who may be conceivably possessed by genius." A postmodernist and a key figure of the beat generation, he focused his art on a relentless subversion of the moral, political, and economic conventions of modern American society, as reflected in his often darkly humorous and sardonic satire. He wrote eighteen novels and novellas, six short-story collections, and four collections of essays. No fewer than five books of his interviews and correspondence have been published. He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians and made many appearances in films. He was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1983 and in the following year was appointed to the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.</p>''The fold-in technique gives excellent comic and satiric results!cleverly combines the raw energy of lowbrow spy- and science fiction with the brutal unfamiliarity of hardcore pornography.'' --<i>Spectator</i><br><br>''His Swiftian vision of a processed, pre-packaged life, a kind of electro-chemical totalitarianism, often evokes the black laughter of hilarious horror.'' --<i>Playboy</i></p><h2>Endgame</h2><p>A new town, a new school, a new start.

Everyone interested in Gurdjieff's and Ouspensky's teachings should read all five volumes. Regardless of what spiritual path a person is on, the psychological commentaries can be a big help because they detail on a day-to-day basis the obstacles the false personality creates and how to conquer and remove those obstacles. Very few books have ever been written that go into great detail exposing the tricks the imaginary I uses to prevent people from succeeding in their spiritual goals. The psychological commentaries do just that. The Psychological Commentaries is the classic work on the fundamental ideas of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, expounded by one of their foremost students. The Commentaries, concerned with the immediate processes of applying certain principles in daily life, have come to be known and loved by entire generations of people interested in the ongoing evolution of psychological transformation. One of the leading British psychologists of his time, Maurice Nicoll was a student of Jung, Gurdjieff, and Ouspensky. At the latter's request, he devoted the last twenty years of his life to passing on the ideas he had received from his teachers. This devotion culminated in the five volumes of the Psychological Commentaries on the teaching of Gurdjieff &amp; Ouspensky. The ISBN's are: Volume One 978-0-9829651-5-3.

In its place, the biological sciences increasingly recognise that life isn&#39;t simply a genetically determined programme but is centrally a matter of information and communication systems nested in larger communicative systems. The latter include both internal and external, and natural and cultural, environments. But &#39;information&#39; is an under-unanalysed term in relation to living systems. Accordingly, a new interdiscipline, biosemiotics, has grown up to study the ontology of sign relations in biological, aesthetic and technological ecologies. From the Greek bios for life and semeion for sign, biosemiotics is the study of these intertwined natural and cultural sign systems of the living. Expecting the Earth draws on the semiotic philosophy of the American scientist and logician Charles Sanders Peirce, the semiotic ethology of Jakob von Uexkull&#39;s Umwelt Theory, Gregory Bateson&#39;s cybernetic ecology of mind, Jesper Hoffmeyer&#39;s development of biosemiotics, and briefly upon philosophical precursors such as Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari and Gilbert Simondon, as well as the growth of ecological developmental biology more widely. In this book, Wendy Wheeler formulates a history and theory of biosemiotic and proto-biosemiotic thinking in order to open up new possibilities of contemporary social, philosophical, aesthetic and technological engagement. This is essential reading for those interested in these groundbreaking new developments, and is relevant to the environmental humanities, social ecology and the life sciences more generally.</p><p>Wendy Wheeler is Professor Emeritus of English Literature and Cultural Inquiry at London Metropolitan University and is currently a Visiting Professor at Goldsmiths College, University of London and in the School of Art, Environment and Cultural Studies at RMIT University in Melbourne Australia where she is the London member of the Art, Ecology, Globalisation and the Interpretation of Science research group.</p><h2>Michelin Green Guide Normandy (Green Guide/Michelin)</h2><p>Updated Green Guide Normandy presents the top attractions, regional introductions, the most interesting towns, shopping hot spots and suggested places to eat and stay for a variety of budgets, allowing travelers to plan their trip carefully or be spontaneous.

This chronological selection of her most notable work offers a delineation of her life and creative development. Formerly associated with the second generation of the New York School, Notley has become a poet with a completely distinctive voice. Grave of Light is a progression of changing forms and styles--an extensive panorama held together explicitly by the shape of the poet&#39;s times. Notley&#39;s poems challenge their subjects head-on, suffusing language with radiant truth.</p><p>ALICE NOTLEY has published more than twenty collections of poems. Her Mysteries of Small Houses (1998) was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. She has received the Griffin Poetry Prize, the Los Angeles Times Book Award for poetry, and an Academy Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She lives in Paris.<i>Starred Review.</i> Over the last quarter-century, Notley has crafted an increasingly important body of work that mixes unabashed lyric beauty with jerky snippets from a capacious mind. Her books, however, have been haphazardly and often obscurely published by both small and major house; this collection brings together, for the first time, poems from all points in Notley's career, making available many pieces that have long been impossible to find. Beginning as a poet of the second generation of the New York School, Notley (who was married to the late Ted Berrigan, and, with their two sons, recently edited his <i>Collected Poems</i>) developed a mostly autobiographical, stream-of-consciousness style. Her meditations and sequences take an array of forms and modes, including collages of her children's voices ("These are my silver mittens Mommy"), short lyrics recalling famous figures ("The late Gracie Allen was a very lucid comedienne"), as well as absurdist poetic diaries and letters ("P.S. My own temperature is a perpetual 101 degrees"). More recent poems that come to terms with her marriage to Berrigan are among her best: " 'You haven't wanted to talk to me since I died,' he says." While somewhat idiosyncratically organized, this is an essential book. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hailed by critics worldwide as extraordinary and irreplaceable there are few volumes that have had as monumental an impact in their field as Hugh Johnsons The World Atlas of Wine sales have exceeded four million copies and it is now published in thirteen languages. World-renowned authors Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson once again combine their unrivalled talents to enhance this masterpiece of wine knowledge. There are now 48 extra pages including 17 new color illustrations 20 new maps and for the first time ever double page spreads and full-page photos in the atlas section for maximum visual impact. New World coverage has been extended for both Australia and South America</p><p><i>The World Atlas of Wine</i> is something of a dream-team production. The names Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson alone recommend any book on which they appear. The fifth edition (in 30 years) of this astonishingly successful book lives up to, and surpasses, its predecessors. In 350 densely packed but never clotted pages the authors manage the extraordinary feat of characterizing wine production throughout the world, from Vancouver Island to Japan--Buddhists first planted vines in that inhospitably precipitous, monsoon-lashed land over a 1,000 years ago. After a substantial introductory section dealing with the history of wine, its making, storage, and enjoyment, we're off. Starting with (where else?) France and Burgundy, each wine area is summarized in terms of its geography, climate, and preferred vines and the appellations, laws, and traditions that govern production. The discussion of Pomerol, for example, tells you a great deal in one short page. Even since 1994, when the fourth edition came out, vast changes have swept the wine world, and many parts of the atlas have been correspondingly completely reworked. South America, Canada, Southern France, Italy, Greece, Eastern Europe, and the Eastern Mediterranean are among the areas that have benefited. The regional maps that form the core of the book are a triumph of clarity. The whole production constitutes a brilliant achievement of organization and synthesis, forming an indispensable resource for any wine lover at all interested in where the wine they drink comes from and why it tastes the way it does. <i>--Robin Davidson, Amazon.co.uk</i>Hugh Johnson is widely regarded as the world&#39;s foremost wine writer and one of the greatest authorities in his field. Hugh&#39;s remarkable series of wine books began in 1966 with the internationally best-selling Wine. Through this and subsequent award-winning titles, including The Story of Wine and The Wine Companion, he reveals a rare talent for making a complex subject both accessible and hugely enjoyable. The first edition of the World Atlas of Wine was published in 1971; acclaimed throughout the world, it has been subsequently translated into 14 languages. Jancis Robinson is internationally renowned for her witty, authoritative wine writing. Her award-winning books, including Vines, Grapes and Wines (1986) and the hugely successful Oxford Companion to Wine (1994, 1999) are among the most important landmarks in wine literature. Critically acclaimed as &#39;our cleverest, most thoughtful wine writer&#39; (The Observer), &#39;awesomely intelligent&#39; (The Guardian) and a &#39;writer of breathtaking clarity&#39; (Wine Spectator), Jancis now lectures, writes and makes regular appearances on television.

The author reminisces about a day when his plane was forced down in the Sahara, a thousand miles from help. There he encountered a most extraordinary small-person. "If you please," said the stranger, "draw me a sheep." And thus begins the remarkable story of the Little Prince, whose strange history he learned, bit by bit, in the days that followed. There are few stories that in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one.<p> Antoine de Saint-Exupï¿½ry (1900-1944) was the author of numerous books on the subject of aviation, many of which have become classics of French and world literature.</p></p><p>Antoine de Saint-Exupï¿½ry first published <i>The Little Prince</i> in 1943, only a year before his Lockheed P-38 vanished over the Mediterranean during a reconnaissance mission. More than a half century later, this fable of love and loneliness has lost none of its power. The narrator is a downed pilot in the Sahara Desert, frantically trying to repair his wrecked plane. His efforts are interrupted one day by the apparition of a little, well, prince, who asks him to draw a sheep. "In the face of an overpowering mystery, you don't dare disobey," the narrator recalls. "Absurd as it seemed, a thousand miles from all inhabited regions and in danger of death, I took a scrap of paper and a pen out of my pocket." And so begins their dialogue, which stretches the narrator's imagination in all sorts of surprising, childlike directions.<p> The Little Prince describes his journey from planet to planet, each tiny world populated by a single adult. It's a wonderfully inventive sequence, which evokes not only the great fairy tales but also such monuments of postmodern whimsy as Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i>. And despite his tone of gentle bemusement, Saint-Exupï¿½ry pulls off some fine satiric touches, too. There's the king, for example, who commands the Little Prince to function as a one-man (or one-boy) judiciary: </p><blockquote> I have good reason to believe that there is an old rat living somewhere on my planet. I hear him at night. You could judge that old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. That way his life will depend on your justice. But you'll pardon him each time for economy's sake. There's only one rat. </blockquote> The author pokes similar fun at a businessman, a geographer, and a lamplighter, all of whom signify some futile aspect of adult existence. Yet his tale is ultimately a tender one--a heartfelt exposition of sadness and solitude, which never turns into <i>Peter Pan</i>-style treacle. Such delicacy of tone can present real headaches for a translator, and in her 1943 translation, Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard (who did a fine nip-and-tuck job on Stendhal's <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> in 1999) has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect. The result is a new and improved version of an indestructible classic, which also restores the original artwork to full color. "Trying to be witty," we're told at one point, "leads to lying, more or less." But Saint-Exupï¿½ry's drawings offer a handy rebuttal: they're fresh, funny, and like the book itself, rigorously truthful. <i>--James Marcus</i>First published in 1943<br>Previous hardcover edition 2000<br>0-15-202398-4<br></p><h2>Something Cloudy, Something Clear (New Directions Paperbook)</h2><p><p><strong>Tennessee Williams returns to a pivotal moment in his stormy youth in <em>Something Cloudy, Something Clear,</em> which introducer Eve Adamson calls "a delicately woven tapestry of past and present, vulnerability and toughness, impetuous action and mature insight."</strong></p> Something Cloudy, Something Clear&nbsp;is, as Tennessee Williams stated, "one of the most personal plays I&#x2019;ve ever written." Set in Provincetown, Cape Cod, in 1940, the play records Williams&#x2019; experiences during that "pivotal summer when I took sort of a crash course in growing up." On the brink of becoming a successful playwright, Williams was also to "come thoroughly out of the closet" and meet Kip, his first great love.&nbsp;Something Cloudy, Something Clearbrilliantly reimagines that long ago time, now recollected through the filter of all the playwright&#x2019;s successes and failures, joys and regrets. Eve Adamson, director of the original 1981 production, provides an insightful introduction in which she captures the play&#x2019;s heart-breaking appeal: "It is a delicately woven tapestry of past and present, vulnerability and toughness, impetuous action and mature insight. It seeks a reconciliation between love and art, life and death, and-to use two phrases which recur in the play&#x2013;&#x2013;exigencies of desperation and negotiation of terms. The cloudy and the clear."</p><p>Tennessee Williams (1911-1983) is the acclaimed author of many books of letters, short stories, poems, essays, and a large collection of plays, including The Glass Menagerie, A Streetcar Named Desire, Camino Real, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Orpheus Descending, The Night of the Iguana, and The Rose Tattoo.This previously unpublished autobiographical play?it is based on Tennessee Williams: Memoirs (LJ 11/1/75)?was written late in Williams's life and is now being published through his trust. Williams offers a fictionalized remembrance of the pivotal 1940 summer at Provincetown, Cape Cod, where he retreated to rewrite a play intended to be his Broadway debut. While there he had an affair with a Canadian draft-dodger/dancer, Kip, who later died of a brain tumor. Eve Adamson, director of the original 1981 production, maintains in the introduction that the play "seeks a reconciliation between love and art, life and death, and to use two phrases which recur in the play?exigencies of desperation and negotiation of terms." Unfortunately, a thin plot and weak characterizations make it a minor work in Williams's dramatic canon. However, as one of his most personal plays, bearing the mark of Williams's poetic beauty and pathos, it is recommended for all academic and large public libraries.?Ming-ming Shen Kuo, Ball State Univ., Muncie, Ind.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>John Clare - By Himself (Fyfield Books)</h2><p>This volume brings together, in definitive form, all of John Clare's important autobiographical writings.

Okay, strike that. Maybe I am a slouch. Certainly, my posture could be a bit better. But before I started writing I did go to the library and ask around. Here&#x2019;s what I found out: the best books of all time usually start with a classic opening scene. Also, the classic opening scene is supposed to give readers the full flavor of the book, and to introduce the main character in an exciting, compelling, memorable way.<br>So that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m going for here.<br>First, an observation: people seem to assume that comics get a lot of pussy. This may, in fact, be true. Specifically, people assume that comics get a lot of stripper pussy. This, too, might very well be the case&#x2014;but what the hell do I know?<br>Now, I suppose the reason for this type of thinking is that comics and strippers tend to work the same types of fleabag clubs, at all hours of the night, and that we keep seeing each other backstage, where the strippers are probably walking around on their knees, giving blow jobs, while us comics regale them with jokes and impressions and honey-scented semen.<br>Unfortunately, this has not been my experience, although I once managed to get a stripper&#x2019;s phone number. At the time, I counted this as a career highlight, and it&#x2019;s still up there on my list of all-time accomplishments. I wish I could remember what I said to this woman, what line I used, but the entire transaction has been blocked from my memory. It was always such a torturous thing for me, talking to women, trying to get into their pants.<br>If there is a hell, and if that&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m going, there&#x2019;ll probably be an endless gag reel being played on some big-screen television of me trying to talk to women. It would play all the time. It would start out funny, and then it would quickly become frightening&#x2014;because, really, it was a whole new trauma, each time out. For all my charm and girth and apparent good looks, I was a disaster at this sort of thing. Ninety-nine percent of the time, I&#x2019;d get shot down. Once in a while, the woman would look back at me through a fog of smoke and alcohol and say something encouraging like, &#x201c;Wait, I&#x2019;m sorry, were you talking to&nbsp;<i>me</i>?&#x201d;<br>And yet on this one occasion, with this one stripper, the stars aligned and the gods smiled and everything seemed to work as well as it could have worked. Better, even. It&#x2019;s possible the stripper gave me her number by mistake, but I didn&#x2019;t care. All I cared about was that she answered the phone when I called the next day like she was happy to hear from me, which I took as a good sign.<br>I said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me, Gilbert?&#x201d;<br>She said, &#x201c;Do I know you?&#x201d;<br>I said, &#x201c;Yes, we met last night at the club. You gave me your number. You told me to call.&#x201d;<br>She said, &#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br>I said, &#x201c;And this is me, calling.&#x201d;<br>You&#x2019;d think I would have prepared something to say, a piece of witty banter to reinforce the fact that I was a brilliant young comedian, fluent in the art of effortless conversation, but I wasn&#x2019;t smart enough to think things through in just this way.<br>Somehow, she agreed to meet with me. We arranged the time and place. I was terrifically excited, because I&#x2019;d already seen this woman naked, which was like half the battle. In my head it meant that our getting together and having sex was basically a sure thing, and even if it didn&#x2019;t work out I could go home afterward and jerk off to what I remembered of her tight stripper body.<br>All was right in my little corner of the world.<br>Now, all these years later, I wish I could remember the stripper&#x2019;s name. Candy, I think. Or maybe it was Gum.<br>Somehow, I ended up taking her back to my apartment. I thought,&nbsp;<i>This is going well</i>. We started making out, and the whole time all I could think was,&nbsp;<i>Oh my God! I&#x2019;m making out with a stripper!</i><br>Over on her side of the couch, all she could think was,&nbsp;<i>Oh my God! I&#x2019;m making out with a Jew! I&#x2019;m so excited! This man killed my Lord!</i><br>Somehow, her clothes started coming off. She was wearing this very sexy stripper-type underwear. I was half-expecting a pair of day-of-the-week granny panties, reminding us that it was Tuesday, but there I was in the middle of a Victoria&#x2019;s Secret catalogue.<br>Somehow, my clothes started coming off and the stripper didn&#x2019;t run from the apartment in horror. This, too, I took as a good sign. I wouldn&#x2019;t go so far as to suggest that the stripper was impressed with my physical gifts, but at least she wasn&#x2019;t put off. This was certainly something. Not much, but something. By this point, the young lady was committed, I guess you could say. Or, quite possibly, nearsighted.<br>Next thing I knew, we were in my bedroom, about to do it doggy-style. These days, when I do it doggy-style with my wife, it&#x2019;s a little different. She plays dead and I beg. But back then, in the full flower and vigor of my youth, this hot, agreeable stripper was on all fours, and it was possible to stand back from the scene and squint and convince myself that she was the one doing the begging. I couldn&#x2019;t believe my luck. My head was ready to explode. Nothing like this had ever happened to me. It was, without question, the single most thrilling moment of my life. It&#x2019;s a wonder I didn&#x2019;t start barking.<br>And then it was over. Just like that. My stripper friend lifted her butt toward me in a final enticing display, and I congratulated myself yet again for my great good fortune. Then I made my final approach and if I confess here that I managed to hold off for a full second before ejaculating I&#x2019;d be exaggerating. If you must know, I don&#x2019;t think I made it in past the tip, just an inch or so&#x2014;which was a shame, really, because I had a whole other inch or so to go in the physical gifts department. I just slipped my cock into her tight little stripper pussy and shot my wad in no time at all. Maybe I managed a meager half-thrust. I was in such a state of bliss and ecstasy I couldn&#x2019;t control myself.<br>As soon as I came, my stripper friend looked back at me over her naked shoulder with an expression that seemed to be equal parts disgust, disappointment and disregard. Her face was just one big&nbsp;<i>dis</i>&nbsp;after another. She said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to be kidding me, Gilbert. Did you just come?&#x201d;<br>(Careful readers will note here that I&#x2019;ve chosen the more socially acceptable spelling of the word&nbsp;<i>come</i>, as opposed to the more vulgar, more hardcore&nbsp;<i>cum</i>. If the subject&nbsp;<i>cums</i>&nbsp;up later on in these pages I&#x2019;ll probably do the same, but I can&#x2019;t make any promises. After all, I want this book to be accessible to the widest possible audience. With any luck, it&#x2019;ll be something parents can read to their children, for generations.)<br>I couldn&#x2019;t think how to answer. I was a little too out of breath and a little too deep into the throes of my short-lived ecstasy to think much of anything, so I just slipped my limp dick from this lovely stripper pussy and slinked off to the bathroom to bask in my own shame. And, to curse myself for not thinking of Ned Beatty in that great ass-raping scene from&nbsp;<i>Deliverance.</i>&nbsp;It could have saved me, that scene. If I&#x2019;d just thought to picture Ned Beatty on all fours in front of me, instead of this hot, young, tight-bodied stripper, I might have lasted a full thrust.<br>(Or, as an alternative, I could have held on a little bit longer if I was looking at some naked pictures of myself.)<br>When I returned to the bedroom, I was still walking on air. I approached my new lover, who was still on all fours, only now it was because she was looking for one of her contact lenses. I leaned toward her and whispered hotly into her ear, &#x201c;Was it as good for you as it was for me?&#x201d;<br>It was at this point she gave me &#x201c;the look&#x201d;&#x2014;the look that said,&nbsp;<i>Yes, I&#x2019;m a totally hot piece of stripper ass, for now, but in less than a year they&#x2019;ll find my dead body, which by that point will look like it belongs to an eighty-year-old woman, having died from a drug overdose or from being stabbed in the throat by my biker boyfriend. So, you see, I can easily kill you right now and not give it a thought</i>.<br>Well, we&#x2019;ve all been on the receiving end of that look&nbsp;... so I backed off and let my lover be. If there&#x2019;s one thing I know about women, it&#x2019;s when to let them be. God knows, I&#x2019;ve had an awful lot of practice.<br>I called the stripper later to see if she&#x2019;d like to get together again, but there was a silence on the phone that seemed to suggest she was back to giving me that &#x201c;look.&#x201d; And so, in a blind panic, I hung up the phone and went about my business.<br>Okay, so there&#x2019;s my big, sock-o opening. Right out of the gate, you get the full flavor of me and my life so far. It&#x2019;s all right here, in this neat little anecdote. But apparently they want me to write a little bit more, so I&#x2019;ll keep going. Where I&#x2019;m going, I&#x2019;ve got no idea. I&#x2019;m just making this stuff up as I go along, which people tell me is how most authors go about writing their books, so I&#x2019;m not too worried. No kidding, they just make this stuff up, or pull it from thin air, or they stick their fingers down their throats and something comes up, and somehow or other everything comes together and starts to look and feel and smell like a book, which is close enough in my book.<br>(And all this time, I just thought this stuff was written down somewhere.)<br>Another thing I found out on that ill-advised trip to the library is that a lot of these books start at the beginning. A very good place to start, if you believe Julie Andrews. The writer picks a point in time, and shares a few autobiographical anecdotes, and then things really start moving, so I figure I&#x2019;ll give that a try. (Hey, at this point, I&#x2019;m up for anything.) I&#x2019;ll reach back a couple generations and start with my grandmother. I called her Bubbie. In Brooklyn, it wasn&#x2019;t the most original name for a grandmother, but in my defense I had no idea that it was Yiddish for grandmother. I just liked the name. I liked my Bubbie, too. She used to visit us every week, and before she came over she always baked some pastries for us. She was well known for her&nbsp;<i>mandelbrot</i>, which is like Jewish biscotti. (If you happen to be a ninety-seven-year-old Jew, and someone is reading this book to you at the home, you&#x2019;ll know exactly what I&#x2019;m talking about.)<br>As soon as I started ripping open all these Jewish delicacies, my Bubbie would go to work on her English. For some reason, she decided that I would be her helper. She was determined to speak perfect English. All week long, she&#x2019;d collect newspaper articles and remember the one or two words she didn&#x2019;t understand. Or she&#x2019;d hear something on television that made no sense to her, and make a mental note of it. Then, as I stuffed my face, she would tell me the word she didn&#x2019;t understand and ask me the meaning.<br>In addition to her pastries, my Bubbie also came prepared with at least one joke she&#x2019;d heard that week&#x2014;very often with a word or two missing, because she didn&#x2019;t understand it. The one joke I still remember is the only joke she ever told that was even close to off-color. (Probably that&#x2019;s why I remember it.) The joke turned on the Yiddish expression&nbsp;<i>tsuris</i>, which is pronounced&nbsp;<i>tsoo-ris,</i>&nbsp;and basically means &#x201c;troubles&#x201d; or &#x201c;difficulties.&#x201d; The joke went something like this:&nbsp;<i>An old Jewish man is sitting on a train, shaking his head back and forth and crying. Every once in a while, he puts his face in his hands and says, &#x201c;Tsuris! Oy, tsuris! Such tsuris!&#x201d; An Irish man walks by and hears the old man&#x2019;s cries and says, &#x201c;If you have such a sore ass, why don&#x2019;t you go to a doctor?&#x201d;</i><br>My Bubbie lived to 104, which is probably a little too old to consider a ripe old age, because she had already started to turn. I still say she died young. When I was little, she used to take me by the hand to the neighborhood butcher. She would order brains. This, too, wasn&#x2019;t so original. Lots of Eastern European Jews eat brains, it turns out, but I don&#x2019;t want to scare off my Gentile readers, so let me state for the record that not all Jews eat brains. We do, however, all drink the blood of Christian babies.<br>Have I mentioned that we were Jewish? Does that come across? A lot of people, they see my act, and the fact that I&#x2019;m Jewish never enters their minds, which takes me to a true story. On second thought, the story is really more of an aside than a stand-alone anecdote. It&#x2019;s an important distinction, and it&#x2019;s probably in all of our best interests to consider it here, before this book gets away from us. Really, it&#x2019;s more of a space filler than an attempt to advance the story or keep my confused readers turning the pages. As a side note&#x2014;specifically, as a side note to my aside, which I guess puts us way, way off to the side for the moment&#x2014;I should mention that most of the stories I plan to share in this book are true, except for the ones that aren&#x2019;t. Even the asides. This one happens to be true. It was 1980. I was a young comic, about to be discovered. I went to a casting call for the new season of&nbsp;<i>Saturday Night Live.</i>&nbsp;It was the year the show went from being good and relevant and talked about to when it started to suck. It was also the year that my career went from sucking to being good and relevant, but only for a while. I might write a bit more about&nbsp;<i>Saturday Night Live</i>&nbsp;later on, if I need to fill a few pages, but for now I&#x2019;ll tell just enough to set up this story.<br>(Remember, this is meant to be an aside, and I&#x2019;ve read enough book reviews to know that if an aside takes too long to tell it&#x2019;s not really an aside. Then it&#x2019;s more of an&nbsp;<i>amiddle</i>, and it gets in the way of the story. That&#x2019;s about the last thing I want to do, get in the way of my story, which is basically how I&#x2019;ve tried to live my life as well. I prefer to stay out of the way, off to the side, where I&#x2019;m less likely to offend.)<br>Anyway, the show back then was produced by a woman named Jean Doumanian, who happened to be a great friend of Woody Allen. For those of you who aren&#x2019;t familiar with Jean Doumanian&#x2019;s work, she was the type of person who would watch a Marx Brothers movie and say, &#x201c;Well, Margaret Dumont is good, but why do they need those strange gentlemen running around her?&#x201d;<br>It just so happened that Woody Allen himself decided to come down to an NBC screening room one afternoon, to watch the auditions with his good friend Jean Doumanian. Maybe his adopted children were busy that day, with playdates of their own, so he needed to find something to do. He had his reasons, I&#x2019;m sure, and it just so happened that I was one of the comedians he just so happened to catch on tape that afternoon. It also just so happened that I was doomed to overuse the phrase&nbsp;<i>it just so happened</i>, simply because of this strange confluence of events.<br>Let&#x2019;s review: there was me, at the&nbsp;<i>Saturday Night Live</i>&nbsp;audition. There was Jean Doumanian. And then there was every working comic in New York. All in the same room, trying to impress the hell out of each other. And then, a couple days later, there was Woody Allen and Jean Doumanian and another few influential people crammed into a darkened screening room, reviewing our auditions on videotape, so of course it just so happened that we all came together in just this way.<br>Woody sat in the back, off to the side, all by himself.

Creating healthy, delicious, vitamin-infused water is simple, inexpensive and eco-friendly. Author Pam Wenzel was inspired to write Spa Water recognizing that we live in a more health-conscious society, where people have become increasingly aware of the many benefits associated with proper hydration. A seventeen-year breast cancer survivor, Pam discovered a number of correlations between dehydration and health while doing research for the book. She found dehydration could be a major contributing factor--not only to a higher cancer risk, but for digestive problems, back and joint pain, obesity, overall poor health and disease. This collection of mouth-watering and healthful recipes is designed to refresh body and soul.</p><p>Pam grew up in Gig Harbor, Washington and now lives in McKinney, Texas, with her husband, Rusty, and their two children, Palmer and Stevie. Pam s passion for spa water began a few years ago on a weekend golf trip to Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was there, after observing her husband&#39;s frequent trips to the elegant beverage server in the guest lobby, that she realized spa water could not only be the perfect solution to the ever-present challenge of providing her family with a healthier hydration choice, but could also justify the purchase of that gorgeous beverage server that she d had her eye on. A seventeen-year breast cancer survivor, Pam discovered a number of correlations between dehydration and health while doing research for the book. Over one hundred delicious test recipes later, sip by sip Pam&#39;s spa water journey led her down a creative path to a better hydration choice and continues to create a sense of peace and well-being for her entire family.</p><h2>A Worker on the Transcontinental Railroad (Working Life)</h2><p>Looks at the experience of those who built the transcontinental railroad, from the time Congress authorized it to the joining of the railroads in Utah, including crew work, camp life, and settling disputes.</p><p></p><h2>The King Must Die</h2><p>The story of the mythical hero Theseus, slayer of monsters, abductor of princesses and king of Athens.

Viewed as an ideal method for attaining and transmitting an unimpeded experience of enlightenment, they became the main object of study in Zen meditation, where their contemplation was meant to exhaust the capacity of the rational mind and the expressiveness of speech. Koan compilations, which include elegant poetic and eloquent prose commentaries on cryptic dialogues, are part of a great literary tradition in China, Japan, and Korea that appealed to intellectuals who sought spiritual fulfillment through interpreting elaborate rhetoric related to mysterious metaphysical exchanges.<br><br>In this compact volume, Steven Heine, who has written extensively on Zen Buddhism and koans, introduces and analyzes the classic background of texts and rites and explores the contemporary significance of koans to illuminate the full implications of this ongoing tradition. He delves deeply into the inner structure of koan literature to uncover and interpret profound levels of metaphorical significance. At the same time, he takes the reader beyond the veil of vagueness and inscrutability to an understanding of how koan writings have been used in pre-modern East Asia and are coming to be evoked and implemented in modern American practice of Zen. <br><br>By focusing on two main facets of the religious themes expressed in koan records&#x2015;individual religious attainment and the role dialogues play in maintaining order in the monastic system&#x2015;<i>Zen Koans</i> reveals the distinct yet interlocking levels of meaning reflected in different koan case records and helps make sense of the seemingly nonsensical.

In Her Own Words...<p>"The written word has always held a special fascination for me. it seemed uncanny that words, spread across a page just so, had the power to transport me to another time or place. But they could. I spent many hours ensconced in the local library reading-no, devouring-book after book after book. Books were my soul's delight. Even so, in one sense, the stories I read betrayed me. Too few featured African Americans. Fewer still spoke to, or acknowledged the existence of, the particular problems I faced as a black foster child from a dysfunctional and badly broken home. I couldn't articulate it then, but I sensed a need for validation which the books I read did not supply. When I grow up, I thought, I'll write books about children who look and feel like me.</p><p>"I was moved around a lot as a child, always having to adjust to new neighborhoods, new schools, new faces. The most difficult aspect of my constant uprooting was struggling to make new friends, leaving them behind, moving to a new neighborhood, and starting the whole process over again.</p><p>"Yet I had no choice, for I both needed and wanted friends. The fact that friendships were bound to be short-lived only made them more precious to me. Little wonder that friendship is a theme I return to again and again. <i>Growin'</i>, my first book for children, had friendship as its primary focus. The subject recurs in the poems of <i>Something on My Mind</i> and <i>From a Child's Heart.</i> But the subject is most squarely dealt with in <i>Meet Danitra Brown</i>--an ode to friendship if ever there was one!</p><p>"Born in Harlem, I have since lived in every borough of New York City except Staten Island. Consequently, cityscapes form the backdrop of most of my writing.</p><p>"In addition to children's fiction, I write books and magazine articles for adults. I inherited my father's passion for travel and have been to such places as China, Russia, Austria, Trinidad, and Tanzania, where I spent one year. My longest sojourn was in Sweden, where I lived for six years. In fact, I have Sweden to thank for my favorite hobby: knitting. I like to read, of course, go on long walks, talk with friends, cook, and play word games. But most of all, I love to write!"</p>PreS-Gr. 2. Simple poetry and warm, full-page paintings celebrate an African American family's Christmas in a snowy city neighborhood. It's "the story we all know," but that's part of the pleasure of it. Grimes brings a six-year-old girl's fresh viewpoint to the holiday traditions as Nelson's pencil-and-paint images move from the busy streets and the packed store windows to warm close-ups of family hugs and kisses and the excitement of gifts under the decorated tree. The best double-page spread is "Lullaby," in which poem and picture capture the quiet beat of Rhythm Brown, "the blind sax-man," who draws a crowd when he leans into his horn and blows "Silent Night" as if he heard "the Baby's cry." In contrast, there's the active fun that comes when the city is "in shock" from a heavy snowfall. Several pages show people at night, their faces glowing in the candlelight, singing carols in the church pew or sharing the holiday feast. The blend of family, faith, and tradition will have wide appeal. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Now Grace, a spunky girl who romps through the gardens with the laundry maids and court tumblers and rolls her eyes at her fellow <br>ladies, chronicles the court intrigues that swirl around her. . . .<br><br>It&#x2019;s the spring of 1569 and 13-year-old Lady Grace, the youngest lady-in-waiting to the Queen, finds herself at a glittering ball choosing amongst three suitors. But the Queen&#x2019;s generosity turns deadly as threats, dark secrets, and even murder descend on the Tudor court. And it is up to Grace to use her intelligence, stealth, and curious nature to solve the mystery that threatens the very lifeblood of England.</p><p>All miscreants and ill-thinkers, keep out! The Lady Grace Mysteries come from the most privy and secret daybookes of <b>Lady Grace Cavendish</b>, Maid of Honour to Her Gracious Majesty, Queen Elizabeth I of that name. The author lives in Whitehall Palace, Middlesex, in God&#x2019;s Own Chosen Kingdom of England.Reviewed with Grace Cavendish's <i>Betrayal</i>.<p>Gr. 4-7. This new series, ostensibly the diaries (or daybooks) of Lady Grace Cavendish (the real author is British writer Patricia Finney), takes place in the court of Queen Elizabeth I, where Grace serves as a lady-in-waiting. With plenty of twenty-first-century spunk, she solves mysteries that are turning the court upside down. In <i>Assassin</i>, one of Grace's suitors is murdered, and the 13-year-old's cool-headed calculations prove that the lord to whom she has given her hand is not the killer as everyone supposes. He is also not the man Grace believes him to be, so she gives him the boot. In <i>betrayal</i>, another young lady-in-waiting seems to have eloped with Sir Francis Drake, but Grace uses her prognosticating skill and masquerades as a boy to prove otherwise. The books, which occasionally use Old English words (there's a glossary) and handwritten notes, are filled with details of Elizabethan life. An author's note distinguishes fact from fiction. The stories move swiftly, and the mix of history and mystery will keep kids interested. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

By placing the Jains prior to the other &#x201c;renouncer&#x201d; groups, one has a new vision of the way in which ahimsa&#x2dc; or nonviolence developed in India.&#x201d; &#x2015; Lewis Lancaster, University of California, Berkeley<br><br>&#x201c;The work as a whole goes beyond the normal confines within which nonviolence has hitherto been studied.

As a result, he's thrown into Fort Leavenworth prison, where he's subjected to a violent and degrading regime. In this jingoistic era, his familymodel citizens, widely admired in the communitybecome pariahs, solely on the grounds of their loyalty to the nonconforming son. The theme of the book is a celebration of one of the noblest aspects of our cultural tradition: the affirmation of an individual's right to oppose conventional wisdom on the ground of his own principles. Zochert's ( Another Weeping Woman ) evocation of our once-vibrant family farm communities is persuasive, and he has a good eye for landscape, capturing the feel of daily life in the hot, flat Midwestern countryside. Though the writing is not quite crafty enough to avoid tipping into sentimentality, the novel is engrossing and often provocative. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hastur Lord (Darkover #23)</h2><p><b> A never-before-published fantasy novel set in Marion Zimmer Bradley's <i>Darkover</i> universe. </b> <br><br> The world of Darkover, a unique, isolated, and protected world, has long avoided becoming part of the technologically advanced Terran Empire. But things are about to change. Regis Hastur, lord of the most powerful of the seven Domains in Darkover, learns that the Empire is about to become a Federation, and is extending an invitation for all of the worlds to join. While the offer seems tempting to his people, Regis knows that Darkover would become little more than a military base, used for its unique planetary position, and will be sapped of its resources. He must now stop at nothing to save his world.</p><p><b>Marion Zimmer</b> was born in Albany, NY, on June 3, 1930, and married Robert Alden Bradley in 1949. Mrs. Bradley received her B.A. in 1964 from Hardin Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, then did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1965-67.<p>She was a science fiction/fantasy fan from her middle teens, and made her first sale as an adjunct to an amateur fiction contest in <b>Fantastic/Amazing Stories</b> in 1949. She had written as long as she could remember, but wrote only for school magazines and fanzines until 1952, when she sold her first professional short story to <b>Vortex Science Fiction</b>. She wrote everything from science fiction to Gothics, but is probably best known for her <b>Darkover</b> novels.</p><p>In addition to her novels, Mrs. Bradley edited many magazines, amateur and professional, including <b>Marion Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy Magazine</b>, which she started in 1988. She also edited an annual anthology called <b>Sword and Sorceress</b> for DAW Books.</p><p>Over the years she turned more to fantasy; The House Between the Worlds, although a selection of the Science Fiction Book Club, was "fantasy undiluted".

The line between fiction and nonfiction is blurred in this story about Sarah, who is taught to sail by her grandfather and perfects her skills enough to leap from a Puddleduck to a Bluejay sloop. With her grandfather, she sands, varnishes, and paints the Bluejay and then practices learning the ropes of the bigger boat. She enters the Labor Day race and beats several boys who have taken her for granted. This book is peculiar because the plot is predictable and the characters somewhat stereotyped, yet the sailing information, glossary, and drawings are exceptionally good. Readers of fiction may be turned off by the picture-book format, but young sailors will peruse this volume with interest. Color and black pencil sketches accompany the text, but it is the precise sailing drawings that will catch the eye.

Moving from classrooms to local pubs to bullrings, these tales feature an array of men taking stock and reliving past glories, each concerned with loss in different ways-of their place in the world, of their power, their virility, health, and love. "Recuperation" follows a man as he sets off on his daily prescribed walk around his neighborhood, the sights triggering recollections of his family and his younger days. In "Animals", George recalls caring for his children's many pets and his heartfelt effort to spare them grief when they died or disappeared. The title story captures the mixture of bravado and helplessness of four friends who go off to Spain on holiday. Sharply observed, funny, and moving, these thirteen stories present a new vision of contemporary Ireland, of its woes and triumphs, and middle- aged men trying to break out of the routines of their lives.</p><p>Roddy Doyle is an internationally bestselling writer.

Her modest proposal catches fire with millions of citizens, chief among them "an ambitious senator seeking the presidency." With the help of Washington's greatest spin doctor, the blogger and the politician try to ride the issue of euthanasia for Boomers (called "transitioning") all the way to the White House,<br>over the objections of the Religious Right, and of course, the Baby Boomers, who are deeply offended by demonstrations on the golf courses of their retirement<br>resorts.</p><p>Christopher Buckley, "the quintessential political novelist of his time" according to Fortune magazine, is the winner of the distinguished ninth annual Thurber Prize for American Humor, Tom Wolfe has described him as "one of the funniest writers in the English language."<br>Buckley is the author of eleven books, many of them national bestsellers, including Thank You For Smoking, God Is My Broker, No Way To Treat A First Lady, and Florence of Arabia. His books have been translated into over a dozen languages, including Russian and Korean.<br>Government-encouraged suicide isnï¿½t a new idea for fiction--think SOYLENT GREEN, WELCOME TO THE MONKEY HOUSE, and THE CHILDREN OF MEN. But Christopher Buckleyï¿½s approach--mass suicide as a panacea for a defective Social Security system--is boldly absurd and, at the same time, sobering. In other words, itï¿½s everything you expect from good satire. The narrative is timely and amusing, but the real revelation is Janeane Garofaloï¿½s reading. Sheï¿½s great as the voice of Cassandra, the 29-year-old blogger who instigates this social revolution, and sheï¿½s also excellent at voicing the roundtable of special interests--a right-wing evangelist, a dirty-tricks president, and a gung-ho senator who is an amputee. The result is a truly democratic audiobook that makes fun of all parties equally.

The first love in the Bible is not the love of a man and a woman. The first hatred in the Bible is the hatred of a man toward his wife. The first laugh in the Bible is also the last. In <i>Beginnings</i>, Meir Shalev reintroduces us to the heroes and heroines of the Old Testament, exploring these and many more of the Bible&#x2019;s unexpected "firsts." Combining penetrating wit, deep empathy, and impressive knowledge of the Bible, he probes each episode to uncover nuances and implications that a lesser writer would overlook, and his nontraditional, nonreligious interpretations of the famous stories of the Bible take them beyond platitudes and assumptions to the love, fear, tragedy, and inspiration at their heart. Literary, inquisitive, and honest, Shalev makes these stories come alive in all their complicated beauty, and though these stories are ancient, their resonance remains intensely contemporary.</p><p>MEIR SHALEV (b. 1948) is one of Israel's most celebrated writers.

Jesus' riddles, like riddles across many cultures, potentially refer to many different things, and they challenge those who hear them to decode the meaning the riddler intends. Figuring out the riddles in which Jesus spoke requires a depth of faith and close attention to the words of the gospel.

A person&#x2019;s diet has arguably the most significant impact on their health out of any other habit they might have. In that sense, we really are what we eat. In response to a society driven by an extreme hunger for meat and animal products, more and more people are turning to veganism. This plant-based diet eliminates all animal products, and the results include resistance to serious disease, better heart health, and increased energy. So, veganism is great, but it sounds hard. So many of our favorite meals are based on meat, or at least have animal products in them, like eggs and dairy. What can a person do to make transitioning to (and maintaining) that diet easier? Two words: pressure cooking. Pressure cooking is the best way to prepare vegan staples like vegetables and beans because more nutritional value is preserved than through any other cooking method. This means more vitamins and minerals, like iron, which is something most vegans have trouble getting. This book focuses on the Instant Pot, because it is the most popular electric pressure cooker, and is both fast and affordable. There are 100 vegan pressure cooking recipes contained in its pages, so you can start enjoying things like: <li> Chai-spiced oatmeal Tofu scrambles Curry bowls Hearty winter soups &#x201c;Cheese&#x201d; sauces Cornbread and Thanksgiving stuffing Simple syrups Cheesecakes and poached pears Chocolate fondue</li> Vegan food has a reputation for being boring and tasteless, but it won&#x2019;t take you long to see just how untrue that is. By using ingredients like pureed cashews, non-dairy milk, seitan, beans, and more, you can continue making fan favorites by &#x201c;veganizing&#x201d; everything you love. Vegan pressure cooking will impress anyone who tastes your food, vegan or not, and transform the way you see cooking.</p><p></p><h2>Memory and Identity</h2><p>Reflecting on the most challenging issues and events of his turbulent times, Pope John Paul II reveals his personal thoughts in a truly historic document. The world&#39;s greatest communicator offers a moving insight into his intellectual and spiritual journey and pastoral experience. Each chapter suggests the answer to a question which either exercised his mind or which he provoked in discussion with laymen and priests. Using the encounters at his summer residence of Castel Gandolfo where conversations took place with leading intellectuals - philosophers as well as theologians - Pope John Paul II addresses in his book many of the questions which arose from these discussions. Here he leaves for posterity an intellectual and spiritual testament in an attempt to seek the answer to defining problems that vex our lives. The book ends with the Pope&#39;s first ever published comments on the assassination attempt upon his life in 1981. The conversational tone and form of this book indicates to the reader that this is not an academic thesis, more of a friendly talk. Each chapter is, as it were, the answer to a question which many of us carry in our heads or hearts.</p><p>Born Karol Wojtyla in 1920, His Holiness Pope John Paul II was ordained a priest in 1947. He was created a cardinal in 1967. He became Pope on 16th October 1978. Pope John Paul II has already published several monographs straddling theology, philosophy and social policy. He has written plays and poetry, a special account of his pastoral experience in Krakow and collections of sermons delivered in far-flung countries.&#34;I like my Popes intellectual. I like them citing Aristotle, Bentham, John Stuart Mill, Sartre and Dostoevsky... It is gratifying, in this volume of conversations with Pope John Paul II to be treated to philosophical cogitation... John Paul II has long reflected upon such big ideas as freedom and responsibility, love and redemption, totalitarianism, capitalism and the nature of evil... His account of surviving the assassin&#39;s bullet is both touching and human.&#34; -- MARY KENNY NEW STATESMAN &#34;The 11 pages in Memory and Identity which deal with the assassination attempt are the most compelling in the book...

This was Ben's way of telling the world that what he had just done was his own memorial to his great friend and mentor Harvey Penick, who had passed away almost exactly a week before. With Crenshaw's victory, every golfer, every lover of the game, joined Ben in giving thanks to the greatest golf teacher of all time.<br><br>Harvey Penick's life in golf began when he started caddying at the Austin Country Club in Texas at the youthful age of eight. Over the next eighty-plus years, he enlightened the members of that club with insights into golf and life. In 1992, at the age of eighty-seven, he offered the world that same wisdom in a timeless collection of pieces entitled <i>Harvey Penick's Little Red Book.</i> He followed that with three more books, all bestsellers, and all filled with thoughts, stories, and golf advice that had stood the test of time. Now, Bud Shrake, Harvey's friend and collaborator, gathers together the very best pointers, portraits, and parables from all four of Harvey's previous works. Filled with nuggets of wisdom from <i>Harvey Penick's Little Red Book, And If You Play Golf, You're My Friend, For All Who Love the Game,</i> and <i>The Game for a Lifetime</i> and enhanced with dozens of personal photographs and keepsakes from the Penick family scrapbooks, <i>The Wisdom of Harvey Penick</i> is a lasting treasure from the most beloved teacher in all of golf.</p><p>A master of parable and the Socratic method, Harvey Penick, the Texas pro who molded the games of Tom Kite and Ben Crenshaw, emerged late in his long life as the golf world's pied piper. With the phenomenal success of <i>Harvey Penick's Little Red Book</i>, his first primer, Penick earned a dedicated international following eager to hang on his anecdotes and embrace the practicality of his gentle advice that always seems more personal than generic. <i>The Wisdom of Harvey Penick</i> gathers the best of that first volume and joins it with highlights from Penick's three bestselling successors: <i>And If You Play Golf, You're My Friend</i>; <i>For All Who Love the Game</i>, which is geared particularly toward women; and <i>The Game for a Lifetime</i>.

Born in Oregon, she lives in Hawaii. Find out more about the author at www.kateelliott.com or on twitter @KateElliottSFF.<br>The first installment of Elliott's Spiritwalker trilogy puts a decidedly steampunk edge on epic adventure fantasy. The setting is a pseudo-Victorian Europe at the emergence of an industrial revolution, replete with dirigibles, gas lights, and great political and social upheaval. The unpopular cold mages believe that the "reckless tinkering" of radical scientists and natural historians will destroy society. Irreverent orphan Catherine Hassi Barahal mostly thinks about staying out of trouble and finding out about her mysterious explorer parents, but when a cold mage shows up to collect on an old contract, Cat is forced to marry him and undertake a nightmarish journey across an ice-covered country in which she learns frightening things about the mortal and spirit worlds. After a slow start, Elliott pulls out all the stops in a wildly imaginative narrative that will ring happy bells for fans of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And the greatest makers of literature are those whose vision has been the widest, and whose feeling has been the most intense. (from &#34;Literary Taste: How to Form It&#34;)</p><p>Enoch Arnold Bennett, the son of a solicitor, was born in Hanley, Staffordshire in 1867. He was educated locally and at London University, before working initially as a solicitor&#39;s clerk, but soon turned to writing popular serial fiction and editing a women&#39;s magazine. After the publication of his first novel, &#39;A Man from the North&#39; in 1898 he became a professional writer and some of his best and most enduring and acclaimed work, including &#39;Anna of the Five Towns&#39;, &#39;The Old Wives&#39; Tale&#39;, &#39;Clayhanger&#39;, &#39;The Card&#39; and &#39;Hilda Lessways&#39; followed over the next twelve years. Soon after the outbreak of the First World War, Bennett was invited to join the War Propaganda Bureau, concerned with finding ways of best promoting Britain&#39;s interests. He was in good company, as others who contributed to this effort included Conan Doyle, John Masefield, G. K. Chesterton, Sir Henry Newbolt, John Galsworthy, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, Gilbert Parker, G. M. Trevelyan and H. G. Wells. Bernard Shaw knew nothing of the Bureau, but attacked what he believed to be jingoistic articles and poems being produced by British writers. Bennett was the one chosen to defend their actions. He served on a War Memorial Committee at the invitation of the then Minister of Information, Lord Beaverbrook, and was also appointed director of British propaganda in France. His spells in Paris added to his reputation as a man of cosmopolitan and discerning tastes. After the War he inevitably returned to writing novels and also became a director of the &#39;New Statesman&#39;. Bennett&#39;s great reputation is built upon the success of his novels and short stories set in the Potteries, an area of north Staffordshire that he recreated as the &#39;Five Towns&#39;. &#39;Anna of the Five Towns&#39; and &#39;The Old Wives&#39; Tale&#39; show the influence of Flaubert, Maupassant and Balzac as Bennett describes provincial life in great detail. Arnold Bennett is an important link between the English novel and European realism. He wrote several plays and lighter works such as &#39;The Grand Babylon Hotel&#39; and &#39;The Card&#39;. Arnold Bennett died in 1931.</p><h2>Ketogenic Diet and Intermittent Fasting Weight Loss Guide : 5 in 1 Keto Diet For Beginners , Fast Keto Diet , IF With Keto Diet, IF for Women and the Complete Guide To Intermittent Fasting</h2><p><p><b><strong>Do you want to maximize the weight loss and other health benefits you can get from the Ketogenic Diet? </strong></b></p><p><b><strong>How about achieving natural fat burning metabolism and getting to lose 2.3 times more belly fat through Intermittent Fasting?</strong></b></p><p><b>If you have been amongst the folks who have heard of The Ketogenic Diet and Intermittent fasting and are wanting to make it work for you to achieve that natural weight loss without calorie restriction and overly complicated exercise regimes, then you have got to read on!</b></p><p>This is a 5 in 1 collection of books tailored to walk anyone, from beginners to the experienced, step by step through the Keto diet as well as the Intermittent Fasting Lifestyle.

The early Christian materials have often been examined to assess their role in the long-standing negative attitude of Christians to Jews. The motivation for the early church&#x2019;s sometimes harsh attitude was partly theological&#x2015;it needed to define itself over against its parent&#x2015;and partly sociological&#x2015;it needed to make clear the line that divided the fledgling group of Christian believers fromt he group with which it was most likely to be confused. This collection of studies emphasizes the context and history of early Christianity in reconsidering many of the classic passages that have contributed to the development of anti-Judaism in Christianity. The volume opens with an essay that clearly delineates the state of the question of anti-Judaism in early Christianity. Then follow discussions of specific passages in the writings of Paul as well as the Gospels. </p></p><p><p> <b>Peter Richardson</b> taught religious studies at University College, University of Toronto. </p><br><br><p> <b>Richard Granskou</b> taught religious studies at Wilfrid Laurier University. </p>``A model for discussion of its kind.''

Daisy's hooves are sparkly, but they don't produce glitter when she walks, like those of the other magical ponies, so she worries she won't get into the Enchanted Pony Academy. Even after she has been accepted into the academy, she doubts that she is magical enough to be successful&#x2014;the other ponies have amazing talents: glow-in-the-dark horns, the power to crush rocks with one hoof, and the ability to copy any sound.

Jackson ranks as one of the great legislators in American history. With a Congressional career spanning the tenure of nine Presidents, Jackson had an enormous impact on the most crucial foreign policy and defense issues of the Cold War era, as well as a marked impact on energy policy, civil rights, and other watershed issues in domestic politics.<p>Jackson first arrived in Washington, D.C., in January 1941 as the Democratic representative of the Second District of Washington State, at the age of 28 the youngest member of Congress. "Scoop" Jackson won reelection time and again by wide margins, moving to the Senate in 1953 and serving there until his death in 1983. He became a powerful voice in U.S. foreign policy and a leading influence in major domestic legislation, especially concerning natural resources, energy, and the environment, working effectively with Senator Warren Magnuson to bring considerable federal investment to Washington State. </p><p>A standard bearer for the New Deal-Fair Deal tradition of Roosevelt and Truman, Jackson advocated a strong role for the federal government in the economy, health care, and civil rights. He was a firm believer in public control of electric and nuclear power, and leveled stern criticism at the oil industry's "obscene profits" during the energy crisis of the 1970s. He ran for the presidency twice, in 1972 and 1976, but was defeated for the nomination first by George McGovern and then by Jimmy Carter, marking the beginning of a split between dovish and hawkish liberal Democrats that would not be mended until the ascendance of Bill Clinton.</p><p>Jackson's vision concerning America's Cold War objectives owed much to Harry Truman's approach to world affairs but, ironically, found its best manifestation in the actions taken by the Republican administration of Ronald Reagan. An early and strong supporter of Israel and of Soviet dissidents, he strongly opposed the Nixon/Kissinger policy of detente as well as many of Carter's methods of dealing with the Soviet Union. </p><p>Robert Kaufman has immersed himself in the life and times of Jackson, poring over the more than 1,500 boxes of written materials and tapes that make up the Jackson Papers housed at the University of Washington, as well as the collections of every presidential library from Kennedy through Reagan. He interviewed many people who knew Jackson, both friends and rivals, and consulted other archival materials and published sources dealing with Jackson, relevant U.S. political history and commentary, arms negotiation documents, and congressional reports. He uses this wealth of material to present a thoughtful and encompassing picture of the ideas and policies that shaped America's Cold War philosophy and actions.</p><p>"Kaufman's cogent analyses of critical episodes and decisions in which Jackson had a part contribute usefully to knowledge of an era, particularly in energy policy, America's Cold War and international human rights role, and the travails of liberalism and the Democratic Party." -<i>Choice</i></p><p><b>Robert G. Kaufman</b> is associate professor of political science at the University of Vermont. He is the author of <i>Arms Control During the Pre-nuclear Era. </i></p></p><p>Henry "Scoop" Jackson may be one of the most underappreciated American politicians of the second half of the 20th century. He was certainly one of the Democrats' greatest cold warriors, and a man who might have saved his party from the doomed politics of McGovernism if he had only won the presidency, an office he sought twice. (He was, in fact, John F. Kennedy's first choice for a running mate in 1960, until Kennedy became convinced he needed a Southerner on the ticket.) The distinguished gentleman from the state of Washington began his congressional career during the Roosevelt administration, and it ended with his death in 1983 during the Reagan years--a tenure spanning nine presidents. Robert G. Kaufman's comprehensive biography sheds some well-deserved light on its neglected subject. Jackson fought against Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s, for civil rights in the 1960s, and against dï¿½tente with the Communists in the 1970s. He's best known for this last crusade: "Jackson contributed enormously to ensuring that the United States fought and prevailed in this epochal struggle against Soviet totalitarianism." <p> His views prefigured those of the Reagan administration, which was filled with Jackson's neoconservative admirers. Jackson was, in a sense, the very first Reagan Democrat. Kaufman cites Howard Baker, the onetime senator and Reagan's chief of staff: "Jackson made sure we did not lose the Cold War during the 1970s so that Ronald Reagan could win it in the 1980s." If <i>Henry M. Jackson: A Life in Politics</i> is an admiring work, it's because there's so much to admire. Our TV-driven culture tends to lavish its attention on the executive branch and showboating legislators, rather than uncharismatic men of principle like Jackson. That's why serious biographies like this one are so essential--so that history will recognize the role-players who shaped what we have become. <i>--John J.

In <i>Travel &amp; See</i> he presents a diasporic model of criticism that gives close attention to aesthetic strategies while tracing the shifting political and cultural contexts in which black visual art circulates. In eighteen essays, which cover the period from 1992 to 2012 and discuss such leading artists as Isaac Julien, Renï¿½e Green, Kerry James Marshall, and Yinka Shonibare, Mercer provides nothing less than a counternarrative of global contemporary art that reveals how the &#x201c;dialogical principle&#x201d; of cross-cultural interaction not only has transformed commonplace perceptions of blackness today but challenges us to rethink the entangled history of modernism as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Kobena Mercer is Professor of History of Art and African American Studies at Yale University. He is author of <i>Welcome to the Jungle: New Positions in Black Cultural Studies</i>, editor of <i>Cosmopolitan Modernisms</i>, among other titles, and an inaugural recipient of the 2006 Clark Prize for Excellence in Arts Writing.&nbsp;"In <i>Travel &amp; See</i>, his second eagerly awaited collection of writings, Kobena Mercer offers a probing and multifaceted exploration of how the dialogics of black diaspora art at once instance and reframe the deep structures of modern and contemporary culture. Featuring thematic accounts as well as essays on individual artists and exhibitions from across the globe, this volume represents a vital contribution to aesthetic discourse from a compelling writer whose journeys and reflections over the last two decades have become models of critical engagement."&nbsp; (Huey Copeland, author of <i>Bound to Appear: Art, Slavery, and the Site of Blackness in Multicultural America</i>)<br><br>"In <i>Travel &amp; See</i> Kobena Mercer breaks open some of our most trenchant binaries&#x2014;politics and art, primitive and modern, Europe and America&#x2014;by showing us that the black diaspora, with its crisscrossings of the Atlantic and its dense network of affiliations, movements, and practices, is predicated on the polyphony of difference, rather than structural oppositions. Released from this &#x2018;either-or&#x2019; thinking, Mercer has written a trenchant yet delicate account of how artists of the black diaspora have demonstrably shaped the art of our time, bestowing it with a layered and rich meditation on some of the most pressing questions we ask of ourselves: who are we, and, perhaps, more importantly, who would we like to be?"&nbsp; (Helen Molesworth, Chief Curator, The Museum of Contemporary Art)<br><br>"A marvelous work, Kobena Mercer's <i>Travel &amp; See</i> has the potential to introduce a whole new audience to the work of several artists of the black diaspora, while at the same time shifting our understanding of their artistic practice by radically reframing how we understand the very concept of diaspora and diasporic art. Mercer's persistent challenge to an equation of the diasporic histories of these artists with any semblance of identity or identity politics is a soaring accomplishment." (Tina M. Campt, author of <i>Image Matters: Archive, Photography, and the African Diaspora in Europe</i>)<br><br>"Kobena Mercer's work here is no less than a discourse on the transformation from multiculturalism to globalization. Beautifully marrying theoretical framings through psychoanalysis, sociology, and cultural studies with close readings of specific artists and objects, Mercer offers amazing materialist definitions of diaspora that readers will be mining for years to come. A phenomenal book, <i>Travel &amp; See</i> will be incredibly useful to seasoned and new scholars alike."&nbsp; (Kellie Jones, author of <i>EyeMinded: Living and Writing Contemporary Art</i>)</p><h2>The Gourd Dancer: [Poems]</h2><p>Momaday draws on various traditions and influences, especially Native American oral tradition, in poems that shift between nature and society, past and present, actuality and legend</p><p></p><h2>Child of the Mountains</h2><p><i>It's about keeping the faith.<br></i><br>Growing up poor in 1953 in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia doesn't bother Lydia Hawkins.

It ain&#x2019;t right. Leastwise, I don&#x2019;t think so. Them folks that put her there just don&#x2019;t understand our family. My mama&#x2019;s the best mama in the whole wide world. Everbody used to say so afore the awful stuff happened. Even Uncle William. And he don&#x2019;t say much nice about nobody.<br><br>I got to get her out. But how? Even when they&#x2019;s wrong, once grown-ups make up their minds about something, a kid like me don&#x2019;t stand much of a chance of changing it. Poor Mama. I know she hates being caged up like a rabbit, and it&#x2019;s all my fault.<br><br>I feel like my heart done shattered in tiny pieces, like Gran&#x2019;s vase that me and BJ broke playing tag one time. And I ain&#x2019;t got nobody to help me put them pieces back together.<br><br>That&#x2019;s why I stopped by the company store after school yesterday and bought me the biggest spiral notebook they had. Maybe writing everthing down will help me sort it all out.<br><br>&#x201c;Lydia, when you came to be, you was my only star in a dark, dark sky,&#x201d; Mama always said. When I lived in Paradise, Mama and Gran always made me and BJ both feel like we was right special to them.<br><br>But sometimes a body can feel all alone, even when other people live in the same house. That&#x2019;s how I feel living with Uncle William and Aunt Ethel Mae here in Confidence, West Virginia. They be nice enough people, but they ain&#x2019;t got nary a clue about what to do with me.<br><br>The bad stuff commenced like this: My brother, BJ, was borned awful sick, but we didn&#x2019;t know it at first. When Mama birthed me, Gran said I didn&#x2019;t cause Mama no trouble at all. Daddy was at work, so Gran hollered to a neighbor across the road that I was a-coming soon. The neighbor got in his car and went to fetch old Doc Smythson.<br><br>When Doc Smythson comed to help Mama, Gran told him she could manage things just fine, but he said he would be awful obliged iffen she let him help because it was his doctoring duty. So Gran figured it would be okay. But Gran told me that she really done most of the work, after Mama, of course. Gran midwifed most of the women around these parts. She fixed Mama blue cohosh tea to sip and tickled her nose with a feather.<br><br>Gran said, &#x201c;When your mama sneezed, you whizzed out of her like a pellet from a shotgun. All Doc Smythson had to do was hold out his hands to catch you.&#x201d; Gran shook her head. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t like you have to go to some fancy school to learn how to do that!&#x201d;<br><br>But things sure turned out different with BJ. I recollect the whole thing. I was four years old at the time. Gramps and Daddy lived in Heaven by then. Me and Mama and Gran lived in Gramps&#x2019; cabin all by ourselves.<br><br>When BJ was about to come, Mama started bleeding real bad, and she screamed like a hound dog a-howling at the moon. Nothing Gran mixed from her herb bottles helped none. Gran sent me running to the neighbors&#x2019; house to have them find Doc Smythson.<br><br>Doc took one look at Mama and told Gran he had to fetch her to the hospital in Charleston straight away. But we didn&#x2019;t have no ambulance close by where we lived. Sometimes the men from the funeral home took folks to the hospital in their hearse. But they couldn&#x2019;t get to our house soon enough for my mama, tucked way back up in the mountains as we are.<br><br>So Gran wrapped Mama up in blankets, and Doc carried her like a sack of taters to his jeep. Her eyes was closed like she was asleep. I cried out to her, &#x201c;Take me with you, Mama! Take me with you!&#x201d;<br><br>She opened her eyes just a little and looked at me. Her lips said, &#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; but no sound come out at all. Doc sped off with her to the big hospital in Charleston.<br><br>Tears commenced to roll down my cheeks when I watched them drive away. Gran smoothed the hair back from my face with her hands, rough as a cat&#x2019;s tongue. &#x201c;Your mama needs us to stay here and look after things for her, pumpkin,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>When me and Gran went back inside, Gran pulled Mama&#x2019;s bloody sheets offen the bed and took them to the washtub. I couldn&#x2019;t bear to watch the water take Mama&#x2019;s blood away, thinking that was all I had left of her. So I runned under the kitchen table and curled up like a woolly worm that somebody poked with a stick.<br><br>After Gran got done a-scrubbing and a-hanging out the sheets to dry, she leaned under the table and took my hand. &#x201c;Come on, child,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Your mama needs us to be strong for her. Besides, I ain&#x2019;t got the bones for bending down like this. You ain&#x2019;t helping your mama none by hiding under the table. Let&#x2019;s fix up the cabin all nice for her and the baby to come home to.&#x201d; I crawled out, and Gran handed me a little broom Daddy made for me afore he died.<br><br>I got myself busy sweeping the floors ever day Mama stayed at the hospital. Gran said, &#x201c;Lydia, I declare, you&#x2019;re going to wear holes in the floor clean through to Chiny iffen you keep that up.&#x201d; But I wanted them floors to be spanking clean for my mama.<br><br>Mama finally comed back and brought my new baby brother with her. Gran folded up a blanket and laid it in a dresser drawer on Mama&#x2019;s bed for him to sleep in. It made me think of Baby Jesus in the manger to see him lying there all cozied up.<br><br>Mama named my brother Benjamin for my grandpa on Daddy&#x2019;s side and James for my gramps on Mama&#x2019;s side. But he looked just too little to be Benjamin James. I wanted to call him Ben Jim, but Gran said, &#x201c;Mercy, pumpkin, that sounds more like the name of a tonic than a fitting name for a boy. I can hear it on the radio now. &#x2018;Ben Jim heals your soul and heart, mends your body and makes you smart, keeps you strong and cures the farts.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>So we took to calling him BJ instead.<br><br>BJ looked as cute as a speckled steamboat on a spotted river, as Gran used to say, even iffen he was as skinny as a straight pin. He had big blue eyes the color of our pond when it froze over. Them eyes looked clean through you, right inside to your very soul. His hair was the color of a ripe ear of corn. I used to hold him on my lap and tell him stories--about our daddy, about living up here on the mountain, and about how much we all loved him. He&#x2019;d look at me and grin, and this little dimple would creep up like an extra smile.<br><br>Sometimes I&#x2019;d think he sure lucked out being that cute. All I got was plain brown hair, plain brown eyes, and a plain face. And a bunch of awful freckles. I asked Mama, &#x201c;How come I didn&#x2019;t get blue eyes like BJ?&#x201d; She said, &#x201c;You got soft, gentle doe eyes instead, Lydia. Eyes just like your heart.&#x201d; I felt better after that.<br><br>BJ was so tiny he made me come to think of Tom Thumb--a story Gran used to tell me about a little boy the size of his daddy&#x2019;s thumb. BJ mewed like one of our old cat Hessie&#x2019;s kittens when he wanted a drink from Mama&#x2019;s breast. His sucking sounded like purring almost. Sometimes I wished that I could curl up with Mama like that--all safe and warm. But I thought I was too big because Mama was so weak. Feeding BJ seemed about all she could manage. So I didn&#x2019;t ask. Besides, I had to help Gran with the cooking and other chores. I didn&#x2019;t mind so much. I pretended I was all growed up and a real important person.<br><br>One day while Mama slept, Gran let me hold BJ for the very first time. I had to sit in the rocking chair and be real careful. His neck still flopped about like my rag doll. I curled my arm around him when Gran laid him in my lap. He didn&#x2019;t weigh much more than a mess of green beans. I looked down at his big eyes, and he looked up at me. &#x201c;Looky there,&#x201d; Gran said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a-smiling at you.&#x201d;<br><br>I smiled back at him. I knew right then and there that I was somebody special to my baby brother. &#x201c;I will always take good care of you, BJ,&#x201d; I promised in a whisper only he could hear. &#x201c;Always and forever. I won&#x2019;t let nothing bad happen to my BJ.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried real hard to keep that promise, but I couldn&#x2019;t. Gran always reminded us when something bad happened that the rain falls on the just and the unjust. The rain that Gran talked about sure poured down mighty hard on our family.</p><h2>Beautiful Oblivion Limited Edition: A Novel (The Maddox Brothers Series)</h2><p>The <i>Beautiful Disaster </i>and <i>Walking Disaster </i>phenomenon continues in the first heart-pounding new adult romance in The Maddox Brothers series.<br><br>Fiercely independent Camille &#x201c;Cami&#x201d; Camlin gladly moved on from her childhood before it was over.

I sometimes found comfort in that space, but in three months, I&#x2019;d only found unrest. That space became more like a convenient place to hide. Not for me, for him. My fingers ached, so I allowed them to relax, not realizing how hard I&#x2019;d been gripping my cell phone.<br> <br>My roommate, Raegan, was sitting next to my open suitcase on the bed, her legs crisscrossed. Whatever look was on my face prompted her to take my hand. T.J.? she mouthed.<br> <br>I nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Will you please say something?&#x201d; T.J. asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you want me to say? I&#x2019;m packed. I took vacation time. Hank has already given Jorie my shifts.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I feel like a huge asshole. I wish I didn&#x2019;t have to go, but I warned you. When I have an ongoing project, I can be called out at any time. If you need help with rent or anything .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want your money,&#x201d; I said, rubbing my eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought this would be a good weekend. I swear to God I did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d be getting on a plane tomorrow morning, and instead you&#x2019;re calling me to say I can&#x2019;t come. Again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know this seems like a dick move. I swear to you I told them I had important plans. But when things come up, Cami&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have to do my job.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wiped a tear from my cheek, but I refused to let him hear me cry. I kept the trembling from my voice. &#x201c;Are you coming home for Thanksgiving, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>He sighed. &#x201c;I want to. But I don&#x2019;t know if I can. It depends on if this is wrapped up. I do miss you. A lot. I don&#x2019;t like this, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Will your schedule ever get better?&#x201d; I asked. It took him longer than it should to answer.<br> <br>&#x201c;What if I said probably not?&#x201d;<br> <br>I lifted my eyebrows. I expected that answer but didn&#x2019;t expect him to be so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. truthful.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he said. I imagined him cringing. &#x201c;I just pulled into the airport. I have to go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, okay. Talk to you later.&#x201d; I forced my voice to stay level. I didn&#x2019;t want to sound upset. I didn&#x2019;t want him to think I was weak or emotional. He was strong, and self-reliant, and did what had to be done without complaint. I tried to be that for him. Whining about something out of his control wouldn&#x2019;t help anything.<br> <br>He sighed again. &#x201c;I know you don&#x2019;t believe me, but I do love you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I believe you,&#x201d; I said, and I meant it.<br> <br>I pressed the red button on the screen and let my phone fall to the bed.<br> <br>Raegan was already in damage control mode. &#x201c;He was called into work?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, well, maybe you guys will just have to be more spontaneous. Maybe you can just show up, and if he&#x2019;s called out while you&#x2019;re there, you wait on him. When he gets back, you pick up where you left off.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;<br> <br>She squeezed my hand. &#x201c;Or maybe he&#x2019;s a tool who should stop choosing his job over you?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook my head. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s worked really hard for this position.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t even know what position it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I told you. He&#x2019;s utilizing his degree. He specializes in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration, whatever that means.&#x201d;<br> <br>She shot me a dubious look. &#x201c;Yeah, you also told me to keep it all a secret. Which makes me think he&#x2019;s not being completely honest with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stood up and dumped out my suitcase, letting all the contents spill onto my comforter. Usually I only made my bed when I was packing, so I could now see the comforter&#x2019;s light-blue fabric with a few navy-blue octopus tentacles reaching across it. T.J. hated it, but it made me feel like I was being hugged while I slept. My room was made up of strange, random things, but then, so was I.<br> <br>Raegan rummaged through the pile of clothes, and held up a black top with the shoulders and front strategically ripped. &#x201c;We both have the night off. We should go out. Get drinks served to us for once.&#x201d;<br> <br>I grabbed the shirt from her hands and inspected it while I mulled over Raegan&#x2019;s suggestion. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. We should. Are we taking your car, or the Smurf?&#x201d;<br> <br>Raegan shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m almost on empty and we don&#x2019;t get paid until tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Looks like it&#x2019;s the Smurf, then.&#x201d;<br> <br>After a crash session in the bathroom, Raegan and I jumped up into my light-blue, modified CJ Jeep. It wasn&#x2019;t in the best of shape, but at one time someone had had enough vision and love to mold it into a Jeep/truck hybrid. The spoiled college dropout who owned the Smurf between that owner and me didn&#x2019;t love it as much. The seat cushions were exposed in some places where the black leather seats were torn, the carpet had cigarette holes and stains, and the hard top needed to be replaced, but that neglect meant that I could pay for it in full, and a payment-free vehicle was the best kind to own.<br> <br>I buckled my seat belt, and stabbed the key into the ignition.<br> <br>&#x201c;Should I pray?&#x201d; Raegan asked.<br> <br>I turned the key, and the Smurf made a sickly whirring noise. The engine sputtered, and then purred, and we both clapped. My parents raised four children on a factory worker&#x2019;s salary. I never asked them to help me buy a car, instead I got a job at the local ice cream shop when I was fifteen, and saved $557.11. The Smurf wasn&#x2019;t the vehicle I dreamed about when I was little, but 550 bucks bought me an independence, and that was priceless.<br> <br>Twenty minutes later, Raegan and I were on the opposite side of town, strutting across the gravel lot of the Red Door, slowly and in unison, as if we were being filmed while walking to a badï¿½ass soundtrack.<br> <br>Kody was standing at the entrance, his huge arms probably the same size as my head. He eyed us as we approached. &#x201c;IDs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fuck off!&#x201d; Raegan snarled. &#x201c;We work here. You know how old we are.&#x201d;<br> <br>He shrugged. &#x201c;Still have to see IDs.&#x201d;<br> <br>I frowned at Raegan, and she rolled her eyes, digging into her back pocket. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t know how old I am at this point, we have issues.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Raegan. Quit busting my balls and let me see the damn thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The last time I let you see something you didn&#x2019;t call me for three days.&#x201d;<br> <br>He cringed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re never going to get over that, are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>She tossed her ID at Kody and he slapped it against his chest. He glanced at it, and then handed it back, looking at me expectantly. I handed him my driver&#x2019;s license.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thought you were leaving town?&#x201d; he asked, glancing down before returning the thin plastic card to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Long story,&#x201d; I said, stuffing my license into my back pocket. My jeans were so tight I was amazed I could fit anything besides my ass back there.<br> <br>Kody opened the oversize red door, and Raegan smiled sweetly. &#x201c;Thanks, baby.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Love you. Be good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m always good,&#x201d; she said, winking.<br> <br>&#x201c;See you when I get off work?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d; She pulled me through the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are the weirdest couple,&#x201d; I said over the bass. It was buzzing in my chest, and I was fairly certain every beat made my bones shake.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; Raegan said again.<br> <br>The dance floor was already packed with sweaty, drunk college kids. The fall semester was in full swing. Raegan walked over to the bar and stood at the end. Jorie winked at her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Want me to clear you out some seats?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>Raegan shook her head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just offering because you want my tips from last night!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jorie laughed. Her long, platinum blond hair fell in loose waves past her shoulders, with a few black peekaboo strands. She wore a black minidress and combat boots, and was pushing buttons on the cash register to ring someone up while she talked to us. We had all learned to multitask and move like every tip was a hundred-dollar bill. If you could bartend fast enough, you stood a chance of working the east bar, and the tips made there could pay a month&#x2019;s worth of bills in a weekend.<br> <br>That was where I&#x2019;d been tending bar for a year, placed just three months after I was hired at the Red Door. Raegan worked right beside me, and together we kept that machine greased like a stripper in a plastic pool full of baby oil. Jorie and the other bartender, Blia, worked the south bar at the entrance. It was basically a kiosk, and they loved it when Raegan or I were out of town.<br> <br>&#x201c;So? What are you drinking?&#x201d; Jorie asked.<br> <br>Raegan looked at me, and then back at Jorie. &#x201c;Whiskey sours.&#x201d;<br> <br>I made a face. &#x201c;Minus the sour, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>Once Jorie passed us our drinks, Raegan and I found an empty table and sat, shocked at our luck. Weekends were always packed, and an open table at ten thirty wasn&#x2019;t common.<br> <br>I held a brand-new pack of cigarettes in my hand and hit the end of it against my palm to pack them, then tore off the plastic, flipping the top. Even though the Red was so smoky that just sitting there made me feel like I was smoking an entire pack of cigarettes, it was nice to sit at a table and relax. When I was working, I usually had time for one drag and the rest burned away, unsmoked.<br> <br>Raegan watched me light it. &#x201c;I want one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I do!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t smoked in two months, Raegan. You&#x2019;ll blame me tomorrow for ruining your streak.&#x201d;<br> <br>She gestured at the room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m smoking! Right now!&#x201d;<br> <br>I narrowed my eyes at her. Raegan was exotically beautiful, with long, chestnut-brown hair, bronze skin, and honey-brown eyes. Her nose was perfectly small, not too round or too pointy, and her skin made her look like she came fresh off of a Neutrogena commercial. We met in elementary school, and I was instantly drawn to her brutal honesty. Raegan could be incredibly intimidating, even for Kody, who, at six foot four, was over a foot taller than she was. Her personality was charming to those she loved, and repellent to those she didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>I was the opposite of exotic. My tousled brown bob and heavy bangs were easy to maintain, but not a lot of men found it sexy. Not a lot of men found me sexy in general. I was the girl next door, your brother&#x2019;s best friend. Growing up with three brothers and our cousin Colin, I could have been a tomboy if my subtle but still present curves hadn&#x2019;t ousted me from the boys-only clubhouse at fourteen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be that girl,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you want one, go buy your own.&#x201d;<br> <br>She crossed her arms, pouting. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I quit. They&#x2019;re fucking expensive.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stared at the burning paper and tobacco nestled between my fingers. &#x201c;That is a fact my broke ass continues to make note of.&#x201d;<br> <br>The song switched from something everyone wanted to dance to, to a song no one wanted to dance to, and dozens of people began making their way off the dance floor. Two girls walked up to our table and traded glances.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s our table,&#x201d; the blonde said.<br> <br>Raegan barely acknowledged them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me, bitch, she&#x2019;s talking to you,&#x201d; the brunette said, setting her beer on the table.<br> <br>&#x201c;Raegan,&#x201d; I warned.<br> <br>Raegan looked at me with a blank face, and then up at the girl with the same expression. &#x201c;It was your table. Now it&#x2019;s ours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We were here first,&#x201d; the blonde hissed.<br> <br>&#x201c;And now you&#x2019;re not,&#x201d; Raegan said. She picked up the unwelcome beer bottle and tossed it across the floor. It spilled out onto the dark, tightly stitched carpet. &#x201c;Fetch.&#x201d;<br> <br>The brunette watched her beer slide across the floor, and then took a step toward Raegan, but her friend grabbed both of her arms. Raegan offered an unimpressed laugh, and then turned her gaze toward the dance floor. The brunette finally followed her friend to the bar.<br> <br>I took a drag from my cigarette. &#x201c;I thought we were going to have a good time tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That was fun, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook my head, stifling a smile. Raegan was a great friend, but I wouldn&#x2019;t cross her. Growing up with so many boys in the house, I&#x2019;d had enough fighting to last a lifetime. They didn&#x2019;t baby me. If I didn&#x2019;t fight back, they&#x2019;d just fight dirtier until I did. And I always did.<br> <br>Raegan didn&#x2019;t have an excuse. She was just a scrappy bitch. &#x201c;Oh, look. Megan&#x2019;s here,&#x201d; she said, pointing to the blue-eyed, crow-headed beauty on the dance floor. I shook my head. She was out there with Travis Maddox, basically getting screwed in front of everyone on the dance floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, those Maddox boys,&#x201d; Raegan said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said, downing my whiskey. &#x201c;This was a bad idea. I&#x2019;m not feeling clubby tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, stop.&#x201d; Raegan gulped her whiskey sour and then stood. &#x201c;The whine bags are still eyeing this table. I&#x2019;m going to get us another round. You know the beginning of the night starts off slow.&#x201d;<br> <br>She took my glass and hers and left me for the bar.<br> <br>I turned, seeing the girls staring at me, clearly hoping I would step away from the table. I wasn&#x2019;t about to stand up. Raegan would get the table back if they tried to take it, and that would only cause trouble.<br> <br>When I turned around, a boy was sitting in Raegan&#x2019;s chair. At first I thought Travis had somehow made his way over, but when I realized my mistake, I smiled. Trenton Maddox was leaning toward me, his tattooed arms crossed, his elbows resting on the table across from me. He rubbed the five o&#x2019;clock shadow that peppered his square jaw with his fingers, his shoulder muscles bulging through his T-shirt. He had as much stubble on his face as he did on the top of his head, except for the absence of hair from one small scar near his left temple.<br> <br>&#x201c;You look familiar.&#x201d;<br> <br>I raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Really? You walk all the way over here and sit down, and that&#x2019;s the best you&#x2019;ve got?&#x201d;<br> <br>He made a show of running his eyes over every part of me. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have any tattoos, that I can see. I&#x2019;m guessing we haven&#x2019;t met at the shop.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The shop?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The ink shop I work at.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re tattooing now?&#x201d;<br> <br>He smiled, a deep dimple appearing in the center of his left cheek. &#x201c;I knew we&#x2019;ve met before.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t.&#x201d; I turned to watch the women on the dance floor, laughing and smiling and watching Travis and Megan vertically dry fucking. But the second the song was over, he left and walked straight over to the blonde who claimed ownership over my table. Even though she&#x2019;d seen Travis running his hands all over Megan&#x2019;s sweaty skin two seconds earlier, she was grinning like an idiot, hoping she was next.<br> <br>Trenton laughed once. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my baby brother.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t admit it,&#x201d; I said, shaking my head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did we go to school together?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you remember if you went to Eakins at any time between kindergarten through twelfth grade?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did.&#x201d;<br> <br>Trenton&#x2019;s left dimple sunk in when he grinned. &#x201c;Then we know each other.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not necessarily.&#x201d;<br> <br>Trenton laughed again. &#x201c;You want a drink?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have one coming.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You wanna dance?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br> <br>A group of girls passed by, and Trenton&#x2019;s eyes focused on one. &#x201c;Is that Shannon from home ec? Damn,&#x201d; he said, turning a one-eighty in his seat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Indeed it is. You should go reminisce.&#x201d;<br> <br>Trenton shook his head. &#x201c;We reminisced in high school.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I remember. Pretty sure she still hates you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Trenton shook his head, smiled, and then, before taking another swig, said, &#x201c;They always do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a small town. You shouldn&#x2019;t have burned all of your bridges.&#x201d;<br> <br>He lowered his chin, his famous charm turning up a notch. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a few I haven&#x2019;t lit a fire under. Yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>I rolled my eyes, and he chuckled.<br> <br>Raegan returned, curving her long fingers around four standard rocks glasses and two shot glasses. &#x201c;My whiskey sours, your whiskey straights, and a buttery nipple each.&#x201d;...</p><h2>Woods We Live With: A Guide to the Identification of Wood in the Home</h2><p>The Woods We Live With has been written by people who themselves live with, work with, love, buy and sell wood. The fact that they sell and write about wood mostly over 150 years old does not din their enthusiasm and interest for wood, or their ability to convey modern ideas simply. The Sciffers are authors, collectors, antique dealers and appraisers. They also have a cabinet shop doing fine restorations on antique furniture. With their background they bring you some of the tricks of identifying woods and show you how the wood can tell you where and when a piece of furniture was made. Besides this information, this book includes information the Schiffers were able to acquire from experts in the fields of forestry, hardwood sales, museum sciences, cabinet work and mill work as well as their personal knowledge of other furniture dealers and collectors. The color section in this book shows not only the woods most requently used for cabinet making and building, but also woods oxidized and aged. The pictures of secondary woods in oxidized condition and finished ole primary wood surfaces has never been presented before. Twenty-six actual samples of wood are here for your touch and inspection. The authors have pictured wood that you have the greatest chance of seeing and handling. Included are fantastic pictures of the lumber industry.</p><p></p><h2>Singing For A Spirit</h2><p>Follows the story of the Deloria family, whose existence was engulfed and forever changed by the westward expansion of the United States</p><p>Vine Deloria, Jr</p><h2>Index Funds: The 12-Step Recovery Program for Active Investors</h2><p><p>UPDATED for 2015 - This book reveals the potential land mines and pitfalls of active investing and educates readers on the benefits of passive investing with index funds. Hebner's book details the possible perils associated with stock picking, mutual fund manager picking, market timing, and other wealth depleting behaviors. This 12-Step Program teaches the differences between active and passive investing, explains the emotional triggers that impact investment decisions, and offers an enlightening education on science-based investing that may forever change the way an investor perceives the stock market.

Hebner is the founder and president of Index Fund Advisors, Inc., author of ifa.com, and the book Index Funds: The 12-Step Program for Active Investors. That original book received praise from the financial industry and academic legends, including John Bogle, David Booth, Harry Markowitz, Burton Malkiel, and Paul Samuelson. This is a condensed and updated version of that book. Mark is considered a leading author, speaker, and Internet provider of investing education. He is especially knowledgeable about the superiority of index mutual funds, as well as the research indexes designed by financial economists. He earned an MBA at the University of California, Irvine.<p>"Hebner gives us good advice presented in a very appealing manner.

Aronson, Founder of Aronson Johnson Ortiz, Institutional Money Manager</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>James Burt, Foreword Reviews<br> <br> Smart, precise, and funny, Index Funds makes understanding the market sensible and even desirable.<br> <br> Today it&#x2019;s hard to know where to turn for investment advice. Fortunately, Mark T. Hebner&#x2019;s Index Funds: The 12-Step Recovery Program for Active Investors offers educated insight&#x2014;with lots of research and a touch of humor&#x2014;into today&#x2019;s investor arena.<br> <br> Hebner&#x2019;s 12-Step Program is meant as a way to assist people with problems. In this case it&#x2019;s active investors or speculators that have tried to predict market activity to make killer returns and have lost out financially. By contrast, via his self-constructed program, Hebner shows how investing in index funds is a safer, more secure way to invest money to see realistic long-term returns.<br> <br> The author does not act like a guru. His information is clearly researched, right from his definition of index funds and passive investing: a strategy of investing carefully in a diversified portfolio of longstanding stocks and bonds. It makes reference and pays respect to the great money market theorists, from Friedrich von Hayek and Benjamin Graham up to Warren Buffett, Merton Miller, and Eugene Fama. He compiles studies from these famous experts, noting that active stock picking is really a finding-a-needle-in-a-haystack venture. Investors need to subject their managers to the industry T-score to see if they are good at making investment choices.<br> <br> Hebner also returns to a central thesis throughout the book: that no one, no matter how great his or her track record is, can truly predict market activity to pick stocks. His examination of &#x201c;time picking&#x201d; in step 4 shows that those that claim to pick stocks at the right time are usually riding on luck, and that truly great investing depends on, as step 9 says, analyzing &#x201c;historical data over eighty years ... to provide a more reliable estimate of risks and returns.&#x201d;<br> <br> While some books on business advice and understanding marketplaces are often dry and laden with industry jargon, Hebner infuses Index Funds with easy-to-understand explanations of how to invest with index funds. The prose breaks down all the terms of investing&#x2014;&#x201c;riskese,&#x201d; &#x201c;time picking,&#x201d; etc.&#x2014;with short descriptions complete with helpful charts and infographics.<br> <br> Thanks to artist Lala Ragimov, whose renditions of Flemish Baroque and Venetian Renaissance style paintings include investor caricatures, Index Funds also has outright humor that, again, helps explain each concept chapter by chapter.<br> <br> Smart, precise, and funny, Index Funds makes understanding the market sensible and even desirable.</p></p><h2>Darkside: Book 1</h2><p>A bone-chilling thriller about the Darkside of London, where vampires and werewolves stalk the streets and evil lurks....<br><br>Jonathan Starling's home has been attacked, his dad is in an asylum, he's running for his life, and there's nowhere to hide. Jonathan has stumbled upon London's greatest secret: Darkside. Incredibly dangerous and unimaginably exciting, Darkside is the creepiest place Jonathan has ever seen. It's a world of nightmares and secrets, where fear and evil rule, and Jonathan has to find a way out....</p><p>Since Tom Becker learned to hold a pen, he wanted to become a writer. Tom studied history at Oxford University and was inspired by the otherworldly atmosphere of this academic institution. He used to spend long days studying and reading in the University library, but now he spends long days writing. He is the author of the first two books in the Darkside series. His first book in the series, DARKSIDE, was awarded the 2007 Waterstone&#39;s Children&#39;s Book Prize, which celebrates new talent. He lives in the UK.Fourteen-year-old Jonathan Sterling&#39;s secretive father lies in a hospital, mad and sick. This sets Jonathan, a truant student, on a mission to discover his father&#39;s hidden past. References to &#34;the darkness&#34; lead him to a library, where he meets Mary Anne, who has white skin, purple hair, and sedating perfume. She promises to lead him to Darkside, a hidden world beneath London. Colin Moody is chillingly convincing in this portrayal, and his narration becomes mysterious and forbidding as we follow Jonathan underground. Moody highlights Jonathan&#39;s desperation to understand, and then escape, the treacherous nineteenth-century world he finds there, which is peopled with vampires and ghouls. Particularly strong is Moody&#39;s growling depiction of a P.I. &#34;wereman&#34; who nearly eats Jonathan before becoming his friend.

His writing turns brains and minds transparent&#39; Observer When Oliver Sacks, a physician by profession, injured his leg while climbing a mountain, he found himself in an unusual position -- that of patient. The injury itself was severe, but straightforward to fix; the psychological effects, however, were far less easy to predict, explain, or resolve: Sacks experienced paralysis and an inability to perceive his leg as his own, instead seeing it as some kind of alien and inanimate object, over which he had no control. A Leg to Stand On is both an account of Sacks&#39; ordeal and subsequent recovery, and an exploration of the ways in which mind and body are inextricably linked. &#39;In every way a marvelously rich and thoughtful tale&#39; Sunday Telegraph &#39;Oliver Sacks is a neurologist, a man of humane eloquence, and a genuine communicator.

Together with the Poetic Edda, it comprises the major store of Scandinavian mythology. The work is often assumed to have been written, or at least compiled, by the Icelandic scholar and historian Snorri Sturluson around the year 1220. It begins with a euhemerized Prologue, a section on the Norse cosmogony, pantheon and myths. This is followed by three distinct books: Gylfaginning (consisting of around 20,000 words), Skï¿½ldskaparmï¿½l (around 50,000 words) and Hï¿½ttatal (around 20,000 words). Seven manuscripts, dating from around 1300 to around 1600, have independent textual value. Sturluson planned the collection as a textbook. It was to enable Icelandic poets and readers to understand the subtleties of alliterative verse, and to grasp the meaning behind the many kenningar (compounds) that were used in skaldic poetry.</p><p></p><h2>Vintage Diesel Power</h2><p><p>This formative period of diesel locomotive evolution is examined with the help of more than 250 modern and period photos depicting passenger, freight, and switching locomotives.

A small town is besieged by one roaring citizen who becomes a rhinoceros and proceeds to trample on the social order. As more citizens are transformed into rhinoceroses, the trampling becomes overwhelming, and more and more citizens become rhinoceroses. One sane man, Berenger, remains, unable to change his form and identity.</p></p><p>Martin Crimp was born in 1956.

It was a most unfortunate remark for a father to make in front of his daughters, and Baron Jamison realized his blunder as soon as the words were out of his mouth. He was, of course, immediately made sorry for blurting out his unkind comment. </p><p> Three of his four daughters had already taken to heart the foul gossip about Alec Kincaid. They didn't much care for their father's view on the atrocity, either. The baron's twins, Agnes and Alice, wept loudly and, as was their particularly irritating habit, in unison as well, while their usually sweet-tempered sister Mary marched a brisk path around the oblong table in the great hall, where their confused father sat slumped over a goblet of guilt-soothing ale. In between the twins' noisy choruses of outrage, his gentle little Mary interjected one sinful tattle after another she'd heard about the Highland warrior who would be arriving at their home in a paltry week's time. </p><p> Mary, deliberately or nay, was stirring the twins into a full lather of snorting and screeching. It was enough to try the patience of the devil himself. </p><p> Papa tried to give the Scotsman his full defense. Since he'd never actually met the warrior, or heard anything but ill, unrepeatable rumors about the man's black character, he was therefore forced to make up all his favorable remarks. </p><p> And all for naught. </p><p> Aye, it was wasted effort on his part, for his daughters weren't paying the least attention to what he was saying. That shouldn't have surprised him, he realized with a grunt and a good belch; his angels never listened to his opinions. </p><p> The baron was terribly inept at soothing his daughters when they were in a state, a fact that hadn't particularly bothered him until today. Now however, he felt it most important to gain the upper hand. He didn't want to look the fool in front of his uninvited guests, be they Scots or nay, and fool he'd certainly be called if his daughters continued to ignore his instructions. </p><p> After downing a third gulp of ale, the baron summoned up a bit of gumption. He slammed his fist down on the wooden table as an attention-getter, then announced that all this talk about the Scotsman being a murderer was nonsense. </p><p> When that statement didn't get any reaction or notice, his irritation got the better of him. All right, then, he decided, if all the gossip turned true, then mayhap the Scotsman's wife had been deserving of the foul deed. It had probably just started out as a proper thrashing, he speculated, and as things had a way of doing, the beating had gotten a wee bit out of hand. </p><p> That explanation made perfectly good sense to Baron Jamison. His comments gained him an attentive audience, too, but the incredulous looks on his daughters' faces weren't the result he'd hoped to accomplish. His precious angels stared at him in horror, as if they'd just spotted a giant leech hanging off the tip of his nose. They thought him daft, he suddenly realized. The baron's weak temper exploded full measure then, and he bellowed that the sorry woman had probably sassed her lord back once too often. It was a lesson that his disrespectful daughters would do well to take to heart. </p><p> The baron had only meant to put the fear of God and father into his daughters. He knew he'd failed in the extreme when the twins started shouting again. The sound made his head ache. He cupped his hands over his ears to block out the grating noise, then closed his eyes against the hot glare Mary was giving him. The baron actually slumped lower in his chair, until his knobby knees were scraping the floor. His head was bent, his gumption gone, and in desperation, he turned to his faithful servant, Herman, and ordered him to fetch his youngest daughter. </p><p> The gray-haired servant looked relieved by the order, nodding several times before shuffling out of the room to do his lord's bidding. The baron could have sworn on the Holy Cross that he heard the servant mutter under his breath that it was high time that order was given. </p><p> A scant ten minutes elapsed before the baron's namesake walked into the middle of the chaos. Baron Jamison immediately straightened in his chair. After giving Herman a good glare to let him know he'd heard his whispered criticism, he let go of his scowl. And when he turned to watch his youngest, he let out a long sigh of relief. </p><p> His Jamie would take charge. </p><p> Baron Jamison realized he was smiling now, then admitted to himself that it just wasn't possible to stay sour when his Jamie was near. </p><p> She was such a bewitching sight, so pleasing to look upon, in fact, that a man could forget all his worries. Her presence was as commanding as her beauty, too. Jamie had been endowed with her mama's handsome looks. She had long raven-colored hair, violet eyes that reminded her papa of springtime, and skin as flawless and pure as her heart. </p><p> Although the baron boasted of loving all his daughters, in secret, Jamie was his pride and joy. It was a most amazing fact, considering he wasn't her true blood father. Jamie's mother was the baron's second wife. She had come to him when she was nearly full term with her daughter. The man who'd fathered Jamie had died in battle, a bare month after wedding and bedding his bride. </p><p> The baron had accepted the infant as his own, forbidding anyone to refer to her as his stepdaughter. From the moment he'd first held her in his arms, she had belonged to him. </p><p> Jamie was the youngest and the most magnificent of his angels. The twins, and Mary as well, were gifted with a quiet beauty, the kind that grew on a man with time and notice, but his dear little Jamie, with just one look, could fairly knock the wind out of a man. Her smile had been known to nudge a knight clear off his mount, or so her papa liked to exaggerate to his friends. </p><p> Yet there was no petty jealousy among his girls. Agnes, Alice, and Mary instinctively turned to their little sister for guidance in all matters of significance. They leaned on her almost as often as their papa did. </p><p> Jamie was now the true mistress of their home. Since the day of her mama's burial, his youngest had taken on that burden. She'd proven her value early, and the baron, liking order but having no gift for establishing it, had been most relieved to give Jamie full responsibility. </p><p> She never disappointed him. Jamie was such a sensible, untroubling daughter. She never cried, either, not since the day her mama passed on. Agnes and Alice would have done well to learn from their sister's disciplined nature, the baron thought. They tended to cry over just about everything. To his mind, their looks saved them from being completely worthless, but still he pitied the lords who would someday be saddled with his emotional daughters. </p><p> The baron worried most for his Mary. Though he never voiced the criticism, he knew she was a might more selfish than was considered fashionable. She put her own wants above those of her sisters. The bigger sin, however, was putting herself above her papa. </p><p> Aye, Mary was a worry, and a mischief-maker, too. She liked to plow up trouble just for the sheer joy of it. The baron had a nagging suspicion that Jamie was giving Mary unladylike ideas, but he never dared voice that notion, lest he be proven wrong, and fall from grace in his youngest's eyes. </p><p> Yet even though Jamie was his favorite, the baron wasn't completely oblivious to her flaws. Her temper, though seldom unleashed, could ignite a forest fire. She had a stubborn crook in her nature, too. She had inherited her mama's skill for healing, even though he'd specifically forbidden that practice. Nay, the baron wasn't pleased with that inclination, for the serfs and the house servants were constantly pulling her away from her primary duty of seeing to his comforts. Jamie was dragged out of her bed during the mi</p></p><h2>Angelina Ballerina</h2><p>Angelina loves to dance and wants to become a ballerina more than anything else in the world.</p><p>This soft, lovable Angelina with movable arms and legs is a perfect likeness of her picture book counterpart--right down to her winsome smile.

Lucy and Edmund, with their dreadful cousin Eustace, get magically pulled into a painting of a ship at sea. That ship is the <i>Dawn Treader</i>, and on board is Caspian, King of Narnia. He and his companions, including Reepicheep, the valiant warrior mouse, are searching for seven lost lords of Narnia, and their voyage will take them to the edge of the world. Their adventures include being captured by slave traders, a much-too-close encounter with a dragon, and visits to many enchanted islands, including the place where dreams come true. The adaptation is faithful to its source, C.S. Lewis's series of Narnia books, which have provided exciting and uplifting tales for generations of children. BBC Radio does wonders with sound effects--the ship creaks in the wind, the sorrowful dragon roars lugubriously--and musical cues and interludes that keep the pacing dynamic. There's also a splendid cast of plummy British voices, making this far more than a book read onto cassette--it's an audio drama, as enjoyable as a trip to the theater. Grownups who buy this tape for their children will want to borrow it for themselves.

A seven-day menu plan and thirty savory but simple recipes give readers a jump start on feeling great.</p><p>Dr. Cousens, an Ivy League-trained physician, has based his groundbreaking program on the fundamental truth that not all depressions are alike and they do not always have the same physical or mental causes.

With a myriad of depression remedies on the market, from prescription drugs to herbs, and a rapidly increasing number of people seeking relief from depression, Cousens contends that his program incorporates the best of both conventional and holistic techniques. Cousens's five-step program aims to restore balance to disrupted biochemical processes by increasing the intake of mood-boosting amino acids, vitamin supplements and essential fatty acids and by creating a diet and lifestyle that promote physical and mental well-being. Cousens also discusses the reasons why women are more prone to depression, the limitations of antidepressants and how the suggestions in this book can help people break addictions, including alcoholism and related disorders (ADHD, eating disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder). Anyone who has struggled with depression and found little relief with prescription drugs (Cousens reports that some studies indicate that people who receive no treatment fare as well as those who receive counseling and drugs) will find a lot to consider in this far-reaching look at what remains a debilitating element of many lives.

They enjoy exploring history through French and Indian War re-enactment and through medieval re-enactment in the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA). Debbie grew up in southwestern Vermont, where she heard and collected many family stories that she enjoys retelling as historical fiction for young audiences, and as family and local history for genealogists, as well as memory stories of her own life. Debbie graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. in dual majors of social sciences with an education concentration and of English in 2013. She is on hiatus from pursuing her master&#x2019;s degree in linguistics, specializing in teaching English as a second language (TESOL), at Oakland University, in Rochester, Michigan, as a result of going blind and battling long-term illness. Debbie went blind suddenly, without obvious cause, on December 15, 2014, at the age of 45. Her family, friends, and doctors expected her to give in to the darkness and become bitter and angry. Instead, Debbie chose to adopt a positive attitude, even when she felt anything but positive, and to find as much light as possible in her life. She wrote an autobiographical account of her first full year of living in the twilight semi-vision of blindness to share her experience with others; it was also therapy to help her face the darkness. Before going blind, Debbie was an avid, even voracious, reader. She enjoyed drawing in many traditional media and painting in acrylic, gouache, and watercolor. She enjoyed sewing, crocheting, needlepoint, embroidery, beadwork, spinning, and weaving. Since going blind, Debbie has turned to audio books from Audible.com, BARD Talking Books Library, and on CDs. She crochets blankets and crochets scarves for charity. She makes paper beads to make rosaries for the missions. She has recently begun exploring resuming drawing and painting with the limitations of her vision. Debbie is an active member of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) and the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA). She is a past member of the LEO Club, the Lions Club, the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), the Girl Scouts, the Explorer Scouts, and the Order of the Eastern Star (OES), as well as various academic and social groups in high school, college, and graduate school.

Underground. New York. 1976-1980.</h2><p><i>No Wave</i> is the first book to visually chronicle the collision of art and punk in the New York underground of 1976 to 1980. This in depth look at punk rock, new wave, experimental music, and the avant-garde art movement of the 70s and 80s focuses on the true architects of No Wave from James Chance to Lydia Lunch to Glenn Branca, as well as the luminaries that intersected the scene, such as David Byrne, Debbie Harry, Brian Eno, Iggy Pop, and Richard Hell.<br><br>This rarely documented scene was the creative stomping ground of young artists and filmmakers from Jean-Michel Basquiat to Jim Jarmusch as well as the musical genesis for the post-punk explosions of Sonic Youth and is here revealed for a new generation of fans and collectors.<br><br>Thurston Moore and Byron Coley have selected 150 unforgettable images, most of which have never been published previously, and compiled hundreds of hours of personal interviews to create an oral history of the movement, providing a never-seen-before exploration and celebration of No Wave.</p><p>Thurston Moore is one of the founding members of the iconic band Sonic Youth and the author of <i>Mix Tape</i>.<br><br>Byron Coley is an esteemed music writer and editor, who has contributed to numerous publications, including <i>Forced Exposure</i> and <i>Spin</i>.<br>*Starred Review* In 1977, when New York City was still a place where young artists could survive on nothing but their wits, a group of disparate nihilist geeks and renegades coalesced in the vacuum of the postpunk era to test the boundaries of rock music. It was only later that their collective projects would be ascribed under the umbrella of the No Wave &#x201c;movement.&#x201d; If the punk rock of the Ramones and Blondie was a reaction against corporate stadium rock and disco that took rock back to its roots, the No Wave movement was a total break from traditions and conventions that blurred the lines between music, noise, and performance art. Foremost among the progenitors of the angry, acerbic sound was the unlikely pair of Lydia Lunch and James Chance, both featured prominently in photographs and interviews. Four of the bands (the Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, and DNA) were documented on Brian Eno&#x2019;s seminal No New York album; others (Blinding Headache, the Gynecologists, and Theoretical Girls) just faded into obscurity.

The question has been nagging at women off and on (mostly on) for the past sixty years. It's incendiary, much discussed, and, as proven in Yael Kohen's fascinating oral history, totally wrongheaded.</p><p>In <i>We Killed</i>, Kohen pieces together the revolution that happened to (and by) women in American comedy, gathering the country's most prominent comediennes and the writers, producers, nightclub owners, and colleagues who revolved around them. She starts in the 1950s, when comic success meant ridiculing and desexualizing yourself; when Joan Rivers and Phyllis Diller emerged as America's favorite frustrated ladies; when the joke was always on them. Kohen brings us into the sixties and seventies, when the appearance of smart, edgy comedians (Elaine May, Lily Tomlin) and the women's movement brought a new wave of radicals: the women of <i>SNL</i>, tough-ass stand-ups, and a more independent breed on TV (Mary Tyler Moore and her sisters). There were battles to fight and preconceptions to shake before we could arrive in a world in which women like Chelsea Handler, Sarah Silverman, and Tina Fey can be smart, attractive, sexually confident&#x2015;and, most of all, flat-out funny.</p><p>As the more than 150 people interviewed for this riveting oral history make clear, women have always been funny. It's just that every success has been called an exception and every failure an example of the rule. And as each generation of women has developed its own style of comedy, the coups of the previous era are washed away and a new set of challenges arises. But the result is the same: They kill. A chorus of creative voices and hilarious storytelling, <i>We Killed </i>is essential cultural and social history, and&#x2015;as it should be!&#x2015;great entertainment.</p></p><p><p><b>Yael Kohen </b>is a reporter and editor in New York City. A contributing editor at <i>Marie Claire</i>, she covers books, pop culture, and issues important to working women. She has written for <i>New York </i>magazine, <i>Salon</i>, <i>The Daily Beast</i>, the New York <i>Daily News</i>, and <i>The New York Sun</i>.</p><b>1</b><br>&nbsp;<br><i>Mothers of Invention</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Among the politically charged, foulmouthed, and confessional comics who revolutionized the entertainment establishment in the 1950s and early 1960s were two women who upended the image of the traditional comedienne: Phyllis Diller and Elaine May. In style and substance, neither woman had much to do with the other. Diller was a stand-up who built her act around seemingly trivial husband barbs and self-deprecating housewife jokes; May was an improvisational sketch artist who injected her vignettes with highbrow intellectualism and sharp, incisive observations about middle-class life. And yet, both women laid the groundwork for a new kind of female comic. Until Diller and May hit the New York nightclub scene in 1957, comediennes were expected to sing and dance. But that all changed. Diller&#x2014;the prototypical female stand-up&#x2014;proved that women could tell jokes &#x201c;just like a man,&#x201d; while May&#x2014;the mother of sketch comedy&#x2014;introduced the country to improv. While each woman practiced different comedic art forms, both set future generations of funny ladies on one of these two separate but equally important paths to comedy success. And rather than make their names on the vaudeville circuit like many of the best-known comediennes of the past, Diller and May shot to national prominence from a group of small clubs in New York that were slowly changing the face of entertainment.</i><br><b>SHELLY SCHULTZ,</b> <b>talent coordinator and writer,</b> <b><i>The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</i></b> In New York at that time, you had the Copacabana, you had the Plaza Hotel, you had the Empire Room in the Waldorf, you had the Latin Quarter. And the Copacabana was the kind of place that had a line of dancing girls, it had an orchestra, and it had a big-name act and a supporting act and you could eat there. The Latin Quarter was more of a Las Vegas-y kind of thing, also had a line of girls, but they did more production. Barbara Walters&#x2019;s father owned that: Lou Walters. And then the smaller clubs were the Bon Soir and the Blue Angel, and they had the hipper acts. And the Bon Soir and the Blue Angel were very similar. They were both small, they both sat maybe a hundred people, they both had little tiny tables and a cover charge of five, six, or seven dollars. Food was secondary: couldn&#x2019;t get a meal there, really. People came to drink and watch the show. But you had some jazz clubs; you had piano bars. I mean, there was just tons of nightlife, just tons of nightlife. And in those days an agent would need to be out four or five nights a week or more.<br><b>JAN WALLMAN,</b> <b>manager, Upstairs at the Duplex</b> I was from St. Paul, Minnesota. I was married very young and widowed very young at the end of World War II and I came to New York because I wanted to get away from everything out there and I just wanted to go out every night and hear the music. Somebody called me the walking <i>Cue</i> magazine, which was kind of the <i>Time Out</i> of its day. I could always tell you who was performing here, who was performing there. And there were loads and loads of small clubs and big clubs. People went until four in the morning and everybody was out having a good time.<br><b>PAUL DOOLEY,</b> <b>actor and comedian</b> In the late fifties, I was acting and trying to break in as a comedian and I got this dream job, which, to most people, would just be a dumb job: I was helping seat people in a nightclub. But it was the famous Village Vanguard, which is still going in Greenwich Village. It&#x2019;s a jazz room basically and my friends would say to me, &#x201c;You mean for free you get to see Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie?&#x201d; and on and on. And I said, &#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t get to see them for free, I get to see Mike Nichols and Elaine May, Shelley Berman, Lenny Bruce, a guy named Professor Irwin Corey.&#x201d; There were about half a dozen comics who played in that club with these jazz greats. They would open the show and do about thirty or forty minutes and then Charles Mingus or Thelonious Monk or whoever&#x2014;they were all famous jazz people&#x2014;would come on and do their thing for maybe an hour or so. But for me, this was a clinic where I could study all these comedians, and get paid $5 a night to do it.<br><b><i>VARIETY</i></b><b>, January 18, 1956</b> &#x201c;New York is becoming a city of small cafï¿½s and intimeries. The economics of night clubs are such that the postage-stamp sized rooms are a feasible development in the present era. Large rooms, it&#x2019;s felt, have become victim of their own particular brand of economics. The public apparently cannot support more than three in the style to which the large spots have become accustomed. Many regard the present time as an era of shrinkage in niteries and therefore the small spots have a better chance of catching on.<br>&#x201c;In the forefront of the small room development are the Blue Angel, Le Ruban Bleu and the Bon Soir, which are prosperous operations&nbsp;... The Village Vanguard and the Blue Angel also provided the push that helped many toward name status.<br>&#x201c;Many regard the intimeries as a means of resuscitating the nitery biz&nbsp;... <br>&#x201c;Many also feel they do better in a small room entertainment-wise, because of the informality of the proceedings and the absence of a regular show.&#x201d;<br><b>MARSHALL BRICKMAN,</b> <b>writer</b> Every generation that comes up likes to define itself by its own movies or its own music. With us it was with the movies and people like Woody Allen and Mort Sahl and Elaine and Mike. They weren&#x2019;t cheesy Aqua-Velva-scented Vegas kind of cigar-chomping comedians. They were more sensitive, more aware, more cosmopolitan, more cultured, more intelligent. But oddly enough that didn&#x2019;t limit their impact.<br><b>HOWARD STORM,</b> <b>comedian</b> We didn&#x2019;t want to be labeled a Borscht Belt comic, so we started working in the Village. We still did the Catskills in that period&#x2014;those of us who were able to&#x2014;because it was a way to make money. In the Village, you didn&#x2019;t make any money. But the Bon Soir was the club to work in in the Village. It was considered fancy and high-class, kind of a step below the Blue Angel. The Blue Angel was the epitome of the chichi clubs.<br><b>JAN WALLMAN</b> In 1959, this was a time when comedy was going through a change. And it was tough for the guys in that era, because the stand-up guys that had done pretty well had worked in the [Catskill] mountains, which were very active in those days. They told jokes basically and they had a hard time switching over to that first-person conversational kind of comedy. It wasn&#x2019;t telling jokes. It was just being funny. It was a lot more cerebral, if you will, and much more intellectual.<br><b>PAUL DOOLEY</b> The Blue Angel was one of these rooms in New York where these hard-core joke-telling guys would never play. The acts that played the Blue Angel were very discreet, intelligent, hip, and the audience, instead of being noisy and rude and drunk, would just stop and listen to them.<br><b>JAN WALLMAN</b> The Blue Angel had panache; it had a European feel. When I was running the Upstairs at the Duplex I went to the Blue Angel at least every other week on my night off. If I went with another woman who was a friend of mine, they would pick up our check, they&#x2019;d treat us like princesses. If we came with guys, if we had dates, they&#x2019;d make them pay for it. I modeled what I was doing at the Duplex after the Blue Angel, which was my idea of the greatest place in the world. The Bon Soir was quite wonderful too. I hung out at those places before I had a thing of my own to do. But Herbert Jacoby of the Blue Angel was really my mentor and he used some of the acts that started with me. Mine was a room where people started and moved on.<br><b>LAUREN SACKIN,</b> <b>daughter of Nat Sackin, owner of the Bon Soir in the 1960s</b> The Bon Soir was very dark and very small. When you went from West Eighth Street downstairs there was quite a steep set of stairs. It was how you would imagine a speakeasy to be. When you went down, there was a gentleman at a small podium, and I don&#x2019;t know what he was there for&#x2014;maybe he was a bouncer, maybe he was to greet important customers. When you walked in there was a very tiny stage in the front. It was very dark, very gently lit with candles on each table. And there was a little tiny bar in back, a very tiny bar, and that bar was completely gay. Gay men, totally. Straight men did not hang out at that bar, gay women did not hang out at that bar. It was exclusively gay men who hung out at the bar. The nightclub was predominantly straight, but the bar in the back was three or four gay men deep.<br><b>PHYLLIS DILLER,</b> <b>comedian</b> We used to call them discovery clubs. There was a group of discovery clubs, small boï¿½tes: Mr. Kelly&#x2019;s, Bon Soir, Blue Angel, Purple Onion, the hungry i. They all had a gay bar. And it&#x2019;s just where you could work more chicly. You could do some very, very esoteric stuff. And you&#x2019;re working for about, oh, $1,500 a week. But you weren&#x2019;t anybody till you worked the Copa, right? In those days the Copa was for the big boys: Sid Caesar, Carl Reiner, Jerry Lewis, Martin and Lewis. No female comic had ever played the Copa until this agency booked me for $3,000. You played for $3,000, then you&#x2019;d get $5,000 for the next time you played, and then $7,000. That&#x2019;s a three-play deal. I played the $3,000 and told them what they could do with five and seven. I went back to the Blue Angel for $2,000. I did it for my career; I was on the wrong course at the Copa. If I was doing it only for the money I would&#x2019;ve played the three, five, and seven. But I was not right for that room. &#x2019;Cause the audiences were that bad! They were rag people: rag salesmen. They needed titties, and boobs, and dancing girls. They wanted male comics who were sort of Borscht Belt circuit-y; they just needed music and the girls. The gay guys, they were chic. <i>...</i></p><h2>Frontiers in Catholic Feminist Theology: Shoulder to Shoulder</h2><p>What does it mean to be a Catholic woman with feminist commitments today, and what insights can be garnered from that context?

The text is from the New International Version, which is currently among the best-selling editions of the Bible and is written in clear, straightforward language. dePaola uses the text as written with some abridgement to make the stories an appropriate length. Done in his typical style, the illustrations feature stylized people and objects. His children are as winsome looking as ever, but the adults convey sincerity and trust through both facial expressions and body positions. He also makes good use of architectural and decorative detail. There are several illustrations for each story, many of which are full page, and most make dramatic use of color. The large format enhances the impact of the pictures. Like Mother Goose and fairy-tale collections, editions of Bible stories by respected illustrators abound, but this edition should find a place on most shelves as an excellent choice for family or group use as well as for independent reading. --Jane Gardner Connor, formerly at South Carolina State Library, Columbia<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The adventures of Madalene and Louisa</h2><p>Two sisters in Victorian England describe the summer they had no governess and thus were able to &#34;entomologise&#34; as much as they liked.</p><p></p><h2>Uncle Wiggily and His Friends</h2><p>A clever, old gentleman rabbit and his animal pals enjoy eight lively adventures</p><p></p><h2>The Norton Book of Women&#39;s Lives</h2><p>Culled from the autobiographies, journals, and memoirs of some of this centuries most prominent women, this celebration of women&#39;s lives includes the work of Isak Dinesen, Maya Angelou, Joan Didion, Virginia Woolf, Annie Dillard, and others.</p><p>This amazingly rich lode of memoirs, letters, and diaries jumbles together a great roster of 20th-century women, including Virginia Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir, Bernadette Devlin, Emily Mashinini, Sara Suleri, and Santha Rama Rau. <p> Le Ly Hayslip, the sixth child in a Vietnamese peasant family, describes a life pinched between the violence of Viet Cong revolutionaries and South Vietnamese republicans.

Palladio&#x2019;s &#x201c;Villa Rotonda&#x201d; in Vicenza became the most famous building of its kind; it influenced many later designs and remains an important source of inspiration for today&#x2019;s architects. The Palladian style, distinguished by the typical Serlian windows, pillared faï¿½ades resembling Roman temples, symmetrical floor plans, and elevations, was imported to other European countries and became widely known; in Great Britain it was one the important roots of 17th and 18th century architecture. In the 19th century, American architecture heavily referred to the style, as seen in, for example, Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s Monticello home. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Architecture Series features:<ul> <li>an introduction to the life and work of the architect</li> <li>the major works in chronological order</li> <li>information about the clients, architectural preconditions as well as construction problems and resolutions</li> <li>a list of all the selected works and a map indicating the locations of the best and most famous buildings</li> <li>approximately 120 illustrations (photographs, sketches, drafts and plans)</li> </ul></p><p>Manfred Wundram studied art history, archaeology, music history, and German literature.

As a result, she&#39;s struggling to grow up fast; wrestling with poverty, loneliness, and her Mom&#39;s illness every step of the way. Betty, Marie&#39;s Mom, can&#39;t help; she&#39;s living with an illness that&#39;s slowly getting worse and increasingly frightening, and she just doesn&#39;t have the resources left over at the end of the day to help Marie. With her Mom absorbed in her own problems, Marie is essentially alone while she learns to deal with the chaos in her young life. Marie&#39;s youth makes it that much harder for her to cope - as a teenager, she just doesn&#39;t have the life experience to feel confident about her decisions. At the start of the story, we see a scared young girl, uncertain and overwhelmed, but as Betty collapses into a full nervous breakdown, Marie is forced to examine herself and her life and come to a decision: does she continue to be a child, reacting to what&#39;s happening around her? Or does she take control of her life, come what may?</p><p>Von Allan was born red-headed and freckled in Arnprior, Ontario, just in time for Star Wars: A New Hope. The single child of two loving but troubled parents, Von split most of his childhood between their two homes and, consequently, spent a lot of time in the worlds of comics and wrestling. And, to be perfectly honest, what comics and piledrivers didn't teach him, science fiction did. He managed a small independent bookstore in Ottawa, Ontario for many years, all the while working on story ideas in his spare time-- eventually, he decided to make the leap to a creative life, and <i>the road to god knows...</i>, an original graphic novel, was the result. <p> Von currently lives in Ottawa, Canada, with his writer/editor geek wife, Moggy; a husky dog, Rowen; and two feisty cats, Bonny and Reilly.</p><i>The road to god knows ...</i>, the first graphic novel by Canadian artist/writer Von Allan, introduces us to teenager Marie. Her obsession with pro-wrestling aside, Marie herself is fairly normal, though her life is not. Marie's mother Betty is a good-hearted, gentle woman who suffers from schizophrenia. When the story begins Betty has just returned home after a protracted stay at a mental institution. Marie is happy to have her mother back, but also nervous, dreading the erratic behavior that marks a resurgence of her mother's symptoms. Though Marie's father is present in her life, he is divorced from Betty, and Marie is the one left holding the bag, so to speak, when it comes to her mother's care. Marie's close friend, Kelly, is supportive, but it is clear that she is also incapable of truly understanding the issues facing Marie. It's no fault of her own. Kelly simply has no frame of reference. We soon realize how isolated and alone Marie is. <p> There's a lot to like about Allan's art and his storytelling. First and foremost is the fact that Marie is proportioned and dressed like a normal girl, not like some hottie who's fallen out of a Hot Topic catalog. She's a cute girl, but also awkward. The book seems to revel in the adolescent energy and uncertainty surrounding her. Allan's writing is stellar, and his dialogue never feels forced or unnatural. What's to be appreciated most about this book though, is the frank, compassionate way it deals with mental illness. In a day and age when people suffering from these diseases are still ostracized and used as the butt of jokes in popular media, or depicted as gross caricatures, it is a relief to "meet" Betty. Allan never sways from his point: Betty is a good person and a good mother, but she is also struggling to cope with a disease as soul-destroying as any cancer. </p><p> The world needs more books like this. --Sequential Tart (sequentialtart.com),<br><br><i>the road to god knows...</i>, the first graphic novel by Canadian artist/writer Von Allan, introduces us to teenager Marie.

She (Marie) is thrust into the role of an adult far too early, having to essentially take care of her mother when she's not hospitalized with her illness. Marie is also missing a few days of school in trying to cope with this life, and is confronted with teachers who seem determined to make an example out of her without any interest in what she's actually going through. She does have a few bright spots in her life, as her best friend lives right across the street, her dad is at least occasionally around to help out (it's never explained, but her parents are at least separated), and a wrestling show is finally coming to her hometown. Much of the book is spent with Marie trying desperately to have a normal life with her mother unwilling to tell what past trauma has put her into this state, while being unable to get past it and move on with her life. <br> All told, this is a remarkably insightful and honest book. The helplessness of Marie's friend to do her any real good, her dad being unable with work to be any kind of full-time father to Marie, her alienation from kids at school (and even the teachers), all of these things would be bad enough. Throw in a mother who may or may not harm herself or Marie at any moment and who is incapable of being any kind of authority figure in Marie's life and well, I'm impressed. There are all kinds of ways that this comic could have gone wrong, and Von managed to cut through it all and make an outstanding graphic novel. It looks like he has at least another project in the works, and judging from the quality of this book I'd say he's someone to keep an eye on in the future. --Optical Sloth (opticalsloth.com)<br><br>The teenage years are hard, and having a schizophrenic mother does not help that. "The Road to God Knows..." is the coming of age story of one Marie, a teenage girl faced with her single mother's increasingly complex schizophrenia. Forced to grow up before her time, she learns many important lessons. "The Road to God Knows..." is an intriguing and touching graphic novel with a unique art style, highly recommended. --Midwest Book Review, January, 2010<br><br>With the road to god knows... Von Allan demonstrates that he's talented as both an artist and a storyteller. The Ottawa he conjures is beautifully and lovingly detailed -- on par, perhaps, with the London of Dickens or the Cleveland of Harvey Pekar's American Splendor. Stylistically, I'm also reminded of Black Hole by Charles Burns and Sloth (among other things) by Gilbert Hernandez. Regardless of his artistic influences, however, what's clear throughout this graphic novel is that Allan is an optimist who strives to explore the human heart in all of its intricate complexity. --Small Press Reviews, December 28, 2009<br><br>Marie is the fat girl neither peers nor teachers care enough about to really know. She has a golden best friend, one whose little sister looks up to her, and for escapist heroics she follows pro wrestling, which provides relief from the reality of having a schizophrenic mother. Allan sensitively makes Marie the focus of her own story, never preaching to readers or relaying more knowledge than Marie gleans on her own. Initially, his artwork appears awkward. The characters have disproportioned bodies and adopt strange postures. Soon it becomes clear that this awkwardness reflects a major aspect of Marie's point of view. Facial expressions are distinctly rendered, though, and oppressive particulars of Marie's life--the hole in the wall made by the pan her mother threw at her, her overweight and estranged father's habit of sitting around in his Jockeys--drawn with stark simplicity. Allan is realistic about schizophrenia, too, including the dopey condition of a just-medicated patient. Good for those interested in mental-health issues as they relate to families, and also in girl spirit. --Booklist, January 1, 2010</p></p><h2>Eye Wonder: Plant</h2><p>Real-life photographs of flowers, fruits, seeds, leaves, and more offer a unique view of the natural history of plant anatomy and growth.</p><p>Full-color photos.

Can we ground human rights in an abstract rationality possessed by every human being? Or, as some philosophers have claimed, are attempts to ground human rights doomed to failure? Do human rights in any case need such grounding? <i>On Human Rights,</i> the second book in the Oxford Amnesty Lecture Series, presents the opinions of seven distinguished contributors who approach the problem of universal human rights from a variety of perspectives using a wealth of contemporary and historical material.

Four of the writers present their position, using a theoretical paradigm; the others posit an idea with historical and contemporary events such as Bosnia as backdrop. Using terms like utili taria , communitaria , proletaria , libera taria , and egalataria, Stephen Lukes challenges the reader to think of these philosophies in a societal context. John Rawls identifies liberal and hierarchical societies to test the efficacy of human rights. Catherine MacKinnon counters the universal premise that only men suffer human rights violations, pointing out that women continue to be exploited even in peacetime.

It wasn't religion that put them there; it was Tiny, my husband. I have a Buddha round back, too. He was going to give me Moses parting the Red Sea, but I was running out of space. Besides, I told him, I was beginning to feel like a Great Figures in Religion comic book.</p><p>He got dreamy-eyed when he heard that. "Brigham Young," he said. "And some wives."</p><p>I told him: "Tiny, I've got no room for a polygamist."</p><p>Tiny himself had been married three times before he met me, one wife right after the other. I only had him, the one, and he's been dead six months now.</p><p>I met Tiny the summer I graduated high school, 1965, when I was eighteen and he was forty-nine. My cousin Babs, who was a little wild, had a crazy boyfriend (the whole family was worried about it) and he and some of his buddies dared her to get tattooed. She called me up and told me she needed me there and that I was not to judge, squawk, or faint at the sight of blood. She knew none of that was my style, anyhow.</p><p>We drove to Tiny's shop over on East 14th because that's where Steve, the crazy boy, had got the panther that had a toehold on his shoulder. The shop was clean and smelled of antiseptic; Babs and I were disappointed. Sheets of heavy paper in black dime-store frames hung on the walls-flash sheetsarranged by theme: one had Mickey Mouse and Woody Woodpecker; another, a nurse in a Red Cross cap and a geisha offering a drink on a tray. A big flash by the door had more ambitious designs: King Kong and Cleopatra on the opposite sides of one page, looking absentmindedly into each other's eyes. </p><p>Tiny was set up on a stool in back, smoking a cigarette, an itty-bit of a man next to a Japanese screen. He was wearing a blue dress shirt with the cuffs turned back, and his hands and arms were covered with blue-black lines: stars across the knuckles, snakes winding up under the sleeves. The wide flowered tie that spread out over his chest and stomach might've been right on a big man, but on Tiny it looked like an out-of-control garden. His pants were white and wrinkled, and there was a bit of blue ink at the knee; a suit jacket, just as wrinkled, hung on the coat rack in back.</p><p>He eyed our group, scowled at Steve and his two friends, and solemnly winked at me and Babs.</p><p>"So," he said. "Who's the one?"</p><p>"Me," Babs said, trying to sound tough. She told him what she wanted: a little red-and-black bow on her tush. He asked her if she were old enough; she got out her wallet and showed him her driver's license.</p><p>Steve and his friends were buzzing around the shop, looking at the flash and tapping the ones they really liked.</p><p>"Keep your hands off the designs, boys," said Tiny. "I can't tattoo a fingerprint." He turned to Babs. "Okay. Come back of the screen." There was something a little southern in his voice, but I couldn't pick out what it was. He jumped off the stool, and I saw that he was about a full foot shorter than me. I'm six feet tall, have been since eighth grade. I looked right down on top of his slick black hair.</p><p>We all started to follow him. Tiny looked at us and shook his head.</p><p>"You boys have to stay out here."</p><p>"I'm her boyfriend," said Steve. "I've seen it before, and I'm paying."</p><p>"If you've seen it before, you'll see it again, so you don't need to now. Not in my shop, anyhow. You-" he pointed at me "-- come around to testify I'm a gentleman."</p><p>He beckoned us back of the screen to a padded table, the kind you see in doctors' offices, only much lower. Tiny turned around politely while Babs lowered her blue jeans and clam bered up. He spun back, frowned, pulled down just the top of her yellow flowered underwear like he was taking fat off a chicken, and tapped her. "Right here's where you want it?"</p><p>"That's fine."</p><p>"Honey, is it fine, or is it what you want?"</p><p>Babs twisted to look, careful not to catch his eye. "That's what I want."</p><p>He squirted her with antiseptic, got a razor and shaved the area good. I sat on a folding chair across from them.</p><p>Tiny loosened his tie, slipped it off, and hung it, still knotted, on a peg on the wall. "Hey Stretch," he said, looking at me. "What's your name?"</p><p>"Lois.</p><p>"Lois. Like Louise?"' He rolled his shirtsleeves up further. Babs was holding on to the table like a drowning sailor, and Tiny hadn't even got the needle out yet.</p><p>"Lois," I answered, and fast, because I had to talk to him over Babs's hindquarters and that made me a little self-conscious, "after my Uncle Louis. I was going to be named Natalie, after my Uncle Nathan, but then Louis died and Mom liked him better anyhow."</p><p>"My name is Tiny. No story there but the obvious." He picked up an electric needle from a workbench and hunted for the right pot of color.</p><p>"I'm Babs," said Babs, reaching around for a handshake. Tiny was looking elsewhere, and he dipped the needle in some black ink and flipped it on. "For Barbara?" he asked, setting into her skin.</p><p>"A-a-a-a-bigail. Ouch." She gripped the table.</p><p>"Honey," said Tiny, "this doesn't hurt. I got you where you're good and fleshy. Might sting a little, but it doesn't hurt...</p></p><h2>An Essay on Liberation</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p>Jane Yolen has written more than two hundred books for children and adults and is the winner of many prestigious awards in the US, including the Caldecott Medal.Mark Teague&#39;s debut picture book, `The Trouble with the Johnsons&#39;, earned him a feature in Publisher&#39;s Weekly as one of eleven prominent new authors of 1989. Although he developed his writing and painting talents without formal training, he has collaborated with critically acclaimed authors Audrey Wood, Cynthia Rylant and Jane Yolen.He currently lives in Coxsackie, New York, with his wife, Laura, and their two daughters, Lily and Ava.This eighth entry (counting the two board books) in the Yolen/Teague How Do Dinosaurs series features a cast of 10 brightly colored dinosaurs that manage to dominate the double-page spreads without overwhelming them. Questions arise when the dinos are put in common school-day situations. Would dinosaurs walk to school or carpool? Would they stomp and make a fuss on the bus? Would they roughhouse and punch and disrupt the class by yelling or fidgeting with their tails in the air? Of course not. Before they leap out the door at the end of the school day, readers will realize that these dinosaurs are helpful, tidy, and protective, "growling at the bullies till the bullying ends." Yolen's short, rhyming text and Teague's irresistible, cavorting dinosaurs perfectly convey how dinosaurs could behave in school, large and powerful though they may be. Fans of the other titles in the series will welcome this new lesson on how to behave properly yet manage to remain a true dinosaur. <i>Randall Enos</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Angus is one of the earliest Celtic deities and one of the most beloved. He is a trickster and a romantic, a combination of Eros and Apollo, with four birds fluttering about his head, each of which is a kiss. He has the power to reveal to you in a dream your true love, if asked, and if in the mood. In McCall Smith&#x2019;s magical new vision of the ancient tales, five different young men named Angus find themselves living the myths of their namesake, from his search for the girl he loves to his discovery that the man who raised him is not his father. In the hands of one of the great storytellers living today, <i>Dream Angus</i> will charm and mesmerize readers.</p><p>Alexander McCall Smith is best known for The No. 1 Ladies&#39; Detective Agency series, beloved New York Times and international best sellers. A practicing professor of medical law and the author of over fifty books, ranging from children&#39;s fiction to folktales to The Criminal Law of Botswana, he lives in Edinburgh.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>This story is a retelling of the myth of Angus, a popular and attractive figure of the Celtic mythology of Ireland and Scotland. Angus is a giver of dreams, an Eros, a figure of youth. He comes down to us from Irish mythology, but he is encountered, too, in Celtic Scotland. He is a benign figure &#x2014; handsome and playful &#x2014; who in modern times has inspired not only the poem of W.B. Yeats, &#x2018;The Song of Wandering Aengus&#x2019;, but also the lilting Scottish lullaby, &#x2018;Dream Angus&#x2019;. <br><br>In this version of the story of Angus, although I have taken some liberties with the original, I have tried to maintain the central features of Angus&#x2019;s life as these are revealed to us in the Irish mythological sources. These sources, though, do not provide much detail, and so I have imagined what his mother, Boann, might be like; I have interpreted the character of his father, the Dagda, in a particular way and have deprived him of the definite article that precedes his name; I have assumed that Bodb was rather overbearing. Purists may object to this, but myths live, and are there to be played with. At the same time, it is important to remind readers of the fact that if they want the medieval versions, unsullied by twenty-first-century interpolation, they still exist, and are accessible. We must bear in mind, however, that those earlier texts are themselves reworked versions of things passed from mouth to mouth, embroidered and mixed up in the process. Myth is a cloud based upon a shadow based upon the movement of the breeze.<br><br>Celtic mythology is a rich and entrancing world, peopled by both mortals and gods. It embraces the notion of parallel universes, the real world and the otherworld. There are signs of the otherworld in the real world &#x2014; mounds, hills and loughs &#x2014; and the location of mythical places is frequently tied to real geographical features. It is no respecter of chronology, though, even if the later Irish heroic tales claim to have happened at a particular time in history. Angus belongs to the early body of stories &#x2014; stories of a time beyond concrete memory.<br><br>In retelling the story of Angus, I have brought him into the modern world in a series of connected stories which for the most part take place in modern Scotland. The part played by Angus, or the Angus figure, in each of these, may be elusive, but such a figure is present in each of them. Unlike some mythical figures, Angus does no particular moral or didactic work: he is really about dreams and about love &#x2014; two things that have always had their mysteries for people. Angus puts us in touch with our dreams &#x2014; those entities which Auden described so beautifully in his Freud poem as the creatures of the night that are waiting for us, that need our recognition. But Angus does more than that: he represents youth and the intense, passionate love that we might experience when we are young but which we might still try to remember as age creeps up. Age and experience might make us sombre and cautious, but there is always an Angus within us &#x2014; Angus the dreamer.<br><br><i>Alexander McCall Smith, 2006<br></i><br><b>1<br>There was water</b><br><br>This happened in Ireland, but the memory of it is in Scotland too. The precise location of things was not so important then, as there was just the land and the sea between them, and people came and went between the lands, and they were brothers and sisters. The land itself was beautiful, with hills that ran down to the sea, and there were cold green waves that broke on the rocks that marked the edge of the land. There were islands, too, with stretches of white sand, and behind the white sand there was the machair, which was made up of meadows on which grew yellow and blue flowers, tiny flowers.<br><br>The gods lived everywhere then, and they moved among the people. But there were some gods who had their own place, and they were sometimes very powerful, as Dagda was. He was one of the great gods, and his people lived on islands at the very edge of the world, where there is just the blue of the sea and the west beyond the blue. They came to Ireland on a cloud, and lived there. Dagda was one of them, the good one, and he had great power, with his cauldron in which there was limitless food, and his great club, with which he could slay many men with a single blow. But he was often kind to men, and he could bring them back to life with the other end of the club. He also had fecund fruit trees which never stopped bearing fruit, and two remarkable pigs, one of which was always being cooked while the other was always growing.<br><br>There are many stories of Dagda and his doings. This one is about how he came to father a boy called Angus, and how Angus delighted all who came across him. In many ways, this was Dagda&#x2019;s greatest achievement, that he gave us this fine boy, who brought dreams to people, and who was loved by birds and people equally and who still is. For Dream Angus still comes at night and gives you dreams. You do not see him do this, but you may spot him skipping across the heather, his bag of dreams by his side, and the sight of him, just the sight, may be enough to make you fall in love. For he is also a dispenser of love, an Eros.<br><br>How was it that Dagda, a great and powerful god, a leader of warriors, should have had such a son? One might have thought, surely, that a god like that would have a son who was skilled in military matters, rather than a dreamer who fell in love and who was a charmer of birds. For an explanation of the gentleness of Angus, we must turn to his mother. She was a water spirit called Boann. Water spirits are gentle; their sons are handsome and have a sense of fun; they sparkle and dart about, just like water, which is the most playful of the elements.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Tarkenton</h2><p>Biography of Vikings quarterback</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Adventures of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie</h2><p>The gumnuts, creatures of the Australian bush, share a series of adventures in this fantasy which shows them looking out for each other while trying to evade the humans.</p><p></p><h2>A Late Phoenix (Rue Morgue Classic British Mysteries)</h2><p>Decades ago, Germans bombed the village at Lamb Lane.

Some of the characters who become prominent in later works in the series do not appear, but Inspector Sloan, Constable Crosby, and Dr. Dabb are sufficient for the present. The action involves an old murder discovered at a WWII bomb site, followed by a new and related murder. Robin Bailey seems to perfectly understand his cast of characters in this endearing and entertaining series. His C.D. Sloan is wry, patient, and ever so slightly stolid. His Constable Crosby the enthusiastic, yet thoughtless young idiot with whom Crosby must work. His Dr. Dabb deep-voiced and business-like as he cuts up the cadavers. Bailey's pacing reflects Aird's gentle humor and highlights her sly social commentary. Well done.

With stylistic panache and vitriolic wit, William Styron depicts conflicts between men of somewhat more than average intelligence and the military machine. In <b>The Long March</b>, a novella, two Marine reservists fight to retain their dignity while on a grueling exercise staged by a posturing colonel. The uproariously funny play <b>In the Clap Shack</b> charts the terrified passage of a young recruit through the prurient inferno of a Navy hospital VD ward. In both works, Styron wages a gallant defense of the free individual--and serves up a withering indictment of a system that has no room for individuality or freedom.</p><p>With stylistic panache and vitriolic wit, William Styron depicts conflicts between men of somewhat more than average intelligence and the military machine.William Styron (1925-2006), a native of the Virginia Tidewater, was a graduate of Duke University and a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. His books include&nbsp;<i>Lie Down in Darkness, The Long March, Set This House on Fire, The Confessions of Nat Turner, Sophie&#x2019;s Choice, This Quiet Dust, Darkness Visible</i>, and&nbsp;<i>A Tidewater Morning</i>.

Its pages are stuffed with greeting cards that can be opened up and read; envelopes filled with letters and appealing trinkets (a neon friendship bracelet, a "handmade" bookmark and a strip of photos); reproductions of postcards, etc. The flow of correspondence starts up when Kristy, stuck in the hospital while her fellow club-members are away on various summer vacations, starts an unusual chain letter in which the writer must "divulge a secret to one person. . . . Then that person has to send a secret to one other person, and so on." The secrets, which frequently refer to previous episodes in the series, range from the slapstick to the poignant. The use of language, the choice of stationery and the distinct handwriting styles are in keeping with each of the characters. The utterly authentic preteen sensibility is enhanced by the combinations of stickers, rubber-stamp designs and goofy slogans which grace the missives and their envelopes.

In this generation the Comforter is portrayed as the one who soothes men in their sins rather than encouraging the Christian who is persecuted for steadfastly standing for holiness and against lawlessness. Hence the Holy spirit is suffering in the house of reputed friends while they worship and praise as if nothing is wrong and great things are happening. Servants of God will grieve with Him after reading this scholarly and provocative discourse on the most neglected ministry of the Spirit. This book will enlighten the saint, convict the sinner and harden the reprobate. &#34;A masterpiece of timely truth,&#34; says Bill Burkett, editor of &#34;The Hagios Letter&#34; &#34;This is a powerful, personable and needed book.

The founder of Mountain Travel Sobek, an adventure-travel firm, he has written more than five hundred magazine articles and eleven books. <br><br> Pasquale Scaturro is a renowned geophysicist and adventurer. In 2001 he led the successful Mount Everest expedition that broke four Everest climbing records. In 2004 he became the first person to complete a successful descent of the Nile. Scaturro lives in Colorado, where he heads Exploration Specialists International, which leads expeditions around the globe.Adult/High School&#x2013;In a beautifully integrated confluence of story lines, Bangs combines a historian's reflections on the passing terrain and its ancient civilizations with a contemporary adventurer's riveting account of transiting one of the planet's most extreme environments. From a small sacred pool in the Ethiopian highlands to where the river flows into the Mediterranean over 3200 miles away, the water-borne expedition not only had to navigate Class IV to VI rapids, but also to overcome tropical disease and encounters with armed guerrillas, man-eating crocodiles, sandstorms, and political barriers. The expedition's initial stage involved an ambitious IMAX filming project, which was followed by a core team's effort to complete the record-setting descent of the Blue Nile, traveling past Khartoum, through Sudan, and ultimately to Egypt in 114 days. Scaturro, geophysicist and experienced mountaineer/river explorer who led the venture, kept a journal that forms the basis for the book, and Brown, world-class kayaker, served also as cameraman. With telling detail, this book captures many levels of drama, conveying with insight and a sense of immediacy leadership challenges, logistical crises, and split-second decision-making, as well as reflections on large-scale issues such as environmental consequences of redirecting the flow of the Nile for power-generation schemes. The volume contains two black-and-white maps and a 16-page insert of color photographs, which are key to illuminating the sheer enormity of the undertaking.<i>&#x2013;Lynn Nutwell, Fairfax City Regional Library, VA</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From "new historicism" in literary theory, to "ethnohistory," to "historical sociology," these new approaches have resulted both in more works of historical analysis and in a more self-conscious attempt to locate the human sciences in their own histories.<br>The essays in <i>The Historic Turn in the Human Sciences</i>--eight of them published here for the first time--take stock of these changes from the perspectives of some of the disciplines most deeply involved: anthropology, sociology, political science, law, literary studies, and history itself. Many of the authors have played a crucial role in producing the historic turn in their own disciplines. The volume as a whole, therefore, goes significantly beyond a mere inventory of these changes to ask how and how much history can make a difference; how the practice of history is affected by post-structural and other theories; and what is left of both unproblematized history and social science after the historic turn.<br>Taken together the essays give a sense both of what these various turns to history have in common and what sets them apart. This comparative dimension distinguishes the volume from those that have analyzed the impact of history on a single field or have assayed its effects without including historians themselves.<br>In the wake of the historic turn neither the historical actor nor the historical analyst will ever again be seen as a colossus striding over the pages of history. This volume explains in an extraordinary thought-provoking and challenging way why this must be so.<br>Terrence J.

Rachel Carson's book focused on the poisons from insecticides, weed killers, and other common products as well as the use of sprays in agriculture, a practice that led to dangerous chemicals to the food source. Carson argued that those chemicals were more dangerous than radiation and that for the first time in history, humans were exposed to chemicals that stayed in their systems from birth to death. Presented with thorough documentation, the book opened more than a few eyes about the dangers of the modern world and stands today as a landmark work.Rachel Carson (1907&#x2013;1964) spent most of her professional life as a marine biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. By the late 1950s, she had written three lyrical, popular books about the sea, including the best-selling The Sea Around Us, and had become the most respected science writer in America. She completed Silent Spring against formidable personal odds, and with it shaped a powerful social movement that has altered the course of history.</p><h2>Herend: Traditional Craftsmanship in the 20th Century</h2><p>This book is an overview of Herend porcelain in the 20th century.</p><p></p><h2>Yazoo: integration in a Deep-Southern town</h2><p>Willie Morris books.</p><p></p><h2>little fur family</h2><p>The little fur child is going out to play.

The recent death of her aunt had left her penniless and without a job. Besides, she did like him. So what if he'd made it plain that he wasn't in love with her&#x2014;at least she knew where she stood. It wasn't until <em>after</em> the wedding that she began to wonder if liking was going to be enough....<br><br></p><p>Romance readers around the world were sad to note the passing of Betty Neels in June 2001.Her career spanned thirty years, and she continued to write into her ninetieth year.To her millions of fans, Betty epitomized the romance writer.Betty&#x2019;s first book, Sister Peters in Amsterdam,was published in 1969, and she eventually completed 134 books.Her novels offer a reassuring warmth that was very much a part of her own personality.Her spirit and genuine talent live on in all her stories.It was quite ten minutes after a ragged chorus of church bells had tolled the hour of five before Phoebe tapped on the office door and when bidden, entered. Sister Evans was at her desk, looking as fierce as usual, and without glancing up she asked briskly: 'Yes, what is it?'<p>Phoebe didn't allow the eagerness she felt to sound in her voice. 'I've finished, Sister&#x2014;I'm off at five o'clock.'</p><p>'Very well, Nurse Creswell.' It was a surprised Phoebe who heard Sister wish her a pleasant evening. She thanked her politely and whisked herself out of the office and back down the ward. Almost at the doors old Mrs James sat up in bed. 'Nurse, nurse&#x2014;I feel sick!'</p><p>There wasn't another nurse to be seen. Busy in the sluice or the kitchen or even having a cosy chat in the linen cupboard&#x2014;it was such a safe time on a medical ward, not time for evening medicines, far too early for the getting ready of suppers, a most unlikely hour for a houseman to do a round and Sister safe in her office. Phoebe sighed, nipped into the sluice room for a bowl and hurried back with it. Just my luck, she thought silently, proffering it and arranging a towel in a strategic place, just when she needed at least an hour to get ready before Basil expected her. A precious ten minutes went by before Mrs James decided that she felt better and consented to be tucked up once more.</p><p>The hospital, hedged in by East End streets lined with small grey houses, was old, added to from time to time, regardless of level floors or unnecessary staircases, so that Phoebe was quite out of breath by the time she reached her room in the nurses' home, a state not helped by the speed in which she flung off her uniform, showered and then began to dress. She had given a good deal of thought to what she should wear, Basil had mentioned casually that the party was being given by a cousin of his&#x2014;a real swinger, he had called her, and possessed of stunning good looks. Phoebe, surveying her own very ordinary features in the mirror, wished wholeheartedly that the cousin would spare some of her good looks for her. There was nothing wrong with her face, she supposed, but it would never set the world on fire. And mousy hair did nothing to help, and since no one had ever pointed out that her eyes were beautiful grey and heavily fringed, she set no great store by them. She sat down and did her face and then her hair, twisting it up in a neat knot and pinning it carefully before getting into the new separates she had bought in the January sales, a pleasant shade of green and of a fine jersey, just right for a spring evening. She had only been out with Basil three times, and she was still secretly surprised that she was going out with him and that he seemed to like her. He was one of the most popular housemen and could have taken his pick of any number of girls far prettier than she. He was good-looking too, and never at a loss for conversation. Phoebe thought he was marvellous, and she had a perpetual daydream, in which he fell in love with her, married her and became a successful consultant with a Harley Street practice with her running a flat-fronted Regency house and entertaining his rich patients in a little something from Bellville Sassoon. Nonsense, she told herself firmly several times a day, while a tiny corner of her mind persisted in denying that.</p><p>She put on the plain court shoes she had saved to buy, found her velvet jacket and, with a couple of minutes to spare, made her way round to the car park at the back of the hospital where the staff kept their cars.</p><p>Basil's car was there&#x2014;an elderly Triumph, its vivid red needing a good clean&#x2014;but Basil wasn't; he was at the other end of the row of cars, leaning on the bonnet of a sleek Rover, talking to Staff Nurse Collins whose father was well-heeled enough to keep his daughter in a style quite inaccessible to a nurse living on nothing but her pay. Phoebe stayed where she was, not sure whether to join them or look as though she hadn't seen them. She decided on the latter, and presently was relieved to hear Basil's voice remarking that there she was and why hadn't she given a shout.</p><p>She mumbled something or other, bereft of words as usual when she was with him, although her smile made up for that, and when he opened the car door, she got in. She had hoped he would say something nice about her outfit, but he hardly glanced at it, merely said that they would have to step on it if they weren't to miss the best of the food.</p><p>The cousin lived miles away, near Croydon. What with Basil taking a wrong turning and all the evening traffic, the party was in full swing by the time he had found a place to park the car and they had walked back to the rather staid-looking house in a quiet street. Although neither the house nor the street were quiet; the din met them as they opened the old-fashioned iron gate and pushed open the half-open door.</p><p>The moment they were inside, Phoebe saw that she was dressed quite wrongly; there were dozens of girls there, wearing slinky black dresses with deep vee necklines and no backs worth mentioning, and those who weren't wearing black were in tight pant suits, glittering with gold and sequins. The girl who came to meet them was wearing black satin, skin tight and short; she wore one very large dangling earring and there were pink streaks in her dark hair. She flung her arms round Basil, kissed him with great warmth and then looked at Phoebe. 'Girl-friend?' she enquired, 'Basil, I can't believe it?'</p><p>The amused look she cast at Phoebe sent the colour flying into her cheeks, and it stayed there because Basil looked at her too with a faint derisive smile. 'Hardly that,' he said, but he took Phoebe's arm and squeezed it, and the smile changed so quickly that she thought that she might have imagined it.</p><p>The girl grinned, 'I'm Deirdre,' and when Phoebe said politely: 'How do you do? I'm Phoebe,' she said rather impatiently: 'Well, come on in and meet everyone.' Somebody went past with a tray of drinks and she caught him by the arm. 'Have a drink for a start.'</p><p>It tasted like sugared petrol, but Phoebe sipped it obediently, keeping close to Basil because she didn't know a soul there. True, he threw names at her carelessly from time to time, but faces came and went so rapidly that she never caught up with them. And presently she found herself against a wall and Basil at the other end of the room surrounded by a crowd of people all laughing their heads off. She had hidden her glass behind a great vase filled with lilac and was trying to look as though she was enjoying herself; not that that mattered, because no one noticed her. It seemed like hours later when Basil reappeared, a glass in his hand. 'Hullo there,' he began carelessly. 'Having a good time? I say, this is some party&#x2014;haven't enjoyed myself so much in years.' He looked at her and frowned. 'You look a bit of a wet blanket, darling&#x2014;it's not quite your scene, perhaps.'</p><p>She was anxious to please him. 'Oh, it's lovely,' she assured him. 'I came here just for a minute or two, to get my breath.'</p><p>He dropped a casual kiss on her cheek. 'Oh, good. There's masses of food in the other room, but I daresay you've had all you want.'</p><p>He slid away, leaving her with her mouth watering; she was famished, now that she came to think about it. Hunger sent her edging her way through the people milling round the room. She found a plate and collected tiny sausage rolls, smoked salmon on slivers of brown bread and butter, tiny vol-au-vents, a stick of celery&#x2014; hardly a meal, but it would keep her empty insides quiet for a little while&#x2014;then she found a chair in a corner of the room, and was surprised when presently she was joined by another of the guests. A thin, pale man, in a good grey suit, looking, she had to admit, as much like a fish out of water as she did.</p><p>'On your own?' he asked.</p><p>'No, but I've&#x2014;that is, the man I came with has heaps of friends here&#x2014;and of course he wants to talk to them.'</p><p>He gave her a long considered look. 'Not quite your sort,' he commented. 'Not mine either&#x2014;a lot of layabouts with too much money and nothing to do. You look as though you earn your own living?'</p><p>It was hardly a compliment, but it was so nice to talk to someone that she felt no resentment.

He's a houseman at St Coram's.'</p><p>Her companion said, 'Good Lord,' again, and gave her another faintly pitying look. 'I'd never have believed it of him.'</p><p>She misunderstood him and said earnestly: 'Oh, he's very clever&#x2014;I expect he'll be famous one day.' Her eyes shone with delight at such a prospect and the man looked vaguely uncomfortable.</p><p>'Not very old, are you?' he observed.</p><p>'Twenty-two.' She looked around her. 'Are people beginning to go? I must find Basil '</p><p>'Oh, they'll go to a night club.'</p><p>'Well, I'll have to find him just the same&#x2014;we'll have to get back to St Coram's.' She added politely: 'It's been nice meeting you. I expect you're going to a night club too.'</p><p>He got to his feet. 'God forbid&#x2014;I live here.' He walked away, leaving her gaping after him, and then she forgot him as Basil pushed his way through the people leaving.</p><p>'There you are.

He is also the author of a number of previous titles for children including <b>The Wakening</b>.'Not even here in this place of ghosts and demons and half-formed things!' bellowed the wild-eyed sky pirate captain, his voice cracking as he struggled to make himself heard above the screaming wind. 'Not even here will you be safe from my vengeance!'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The sky ship bucked and swayed as it fought against the violent air currents which kept all but the most reckless or foolhardy from venturing over the lip of the Edge and down into the abyss below. For here, where the warm Mire mud cascaded down over the cliff face in huge oozing mudflows and met the icy air currents of the void below, gales and hurricanes and turbulent fog were whipped up into a frenzy.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'No matter how far down into these infernal depths you descend,' Wind Jackal raged, shaking his fist at the eternal gloom below, 'I shall hunt you down . . .'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Father, please,' the young sky pirate by the captain's side protested, and laid a hand on his shoulder. 'The crew . . .'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Wind Jackal turned from the balustrade at the helm of the Galerider, the look of glazed fury on his face giving way to a frown as he found the eyes of his crew upon him. There was Spillins, the ancient oakelf, high up in the caternest. Ratbit, the swivel-eyedmobgnome, his heavy jacket laden with charms. Steg Jambles, the harpooneer, with young Tem Barkwater, as ever, by his side. Sagbutt, the fierce flat-head goblin, his neck-rings gleaming. And Maris Pallitax, staring up from the fore-deck. They all shared the same expression - one of barely contained panic as they stared wide-eyed at their captain, looking to him for reassurance.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Only the newest member of the crew seemed immune to the terror of this fearful place he had brought them to. The Stone Pilot. Concealed inside the tall conical hood that she never removed, and silent as the day - only weeks earlier - when she had been rescued from the Deepwoods slave market, she tended the flight-rock, seemingly oblivious to all around her. The sight of the Stone Pilot applying the cooling rods and adjusting the blazing sumpwood burners which surrounded the flight-rock seemed to calm thecaptain, for he took the wheel from his son with a grim smile.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Forgive me, Quint,' he said, running his hands over the flight-levers. 'It's just that, after all these years, he seems so close . . .'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>A blast of wind hit the Galerider, making the sky ship shudder from stem to stern, and forcing Wind Jackal to feverishly adjust the hull-weights. His hands raced expertly over the bone-handled flight-levers on either side of the great wheel, raising this one a tad, lowering that one.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Sky curse this infernal wind!' he snarled, scanning the mud-clogged cliff edge. 'I can't hold her much longer. We must find somewhere to tether . . .'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Suddenly, the strident voice of Spillins cried out from the caternest. 'Jutting rock at fifty strides!'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Thank Sky,' Wind Jackal murmured, removing his right hand from the hull-weight levers for a split second; just long enough to put the carved tilderhorn amulet gratefully to his lips. 'Hold her steady as you can, Stone Pilot. We're depending on you. Tem! Ratbit!' he bellowed. 'Man the winch! Steg, prepare to descend.'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>A chorus of voices and a flurry of movement erupted all round the sky ship as the crew hurried to do their captain's bidding, taking up their positions and getting to grips with the ship's heavy equipment. Ratbit barked commands at the young and lanky Tem Barkwater as the pair of them swung the winding-winch round until the great ironwood wheel was jutting out over the port side of the sky ship. Steg Jambles secured a leather harness round his midriff, seized the rope that dangled from the winch-wheel andattached one to the other.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Jutting rock directly beneath us!' Spillins shouted down.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Quint and Maris scurried across the deck - skirting round Filbus Queep the thin-faced quartermaster, who had appeared from his quarters above the aft-hold - and peered over the side. Sure enough, there was the single jutting crag that Spillins had spotted, a small island of stillness and stability amidst the constantly shifting Mire. It stood proud of the oozing white mud, which swirled slowly round it, then poured over the edge in great globules that glistened for a moment, before disappearing into the eternal gloom below.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Quint turned and looked up at the flight-rock platform. The Stone Pilot was standing to the left of the great rock, her back towards him. Since the moment they'd first met, the mysterious figure had uttered not a single word. Yet the hunched urgency with which she worked now, feverishly pumping the rock-bellows and riddling the ashes from the roaring furnace, spoke louder than any words.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Every moment the Galerider hovered here, untethered over the void, it risked being swept away and lost for ever in Open Sky. But the Stone Pilot was a natural, whose skills seemed to grow with every passing day. Under her care now, the heated flight-rockwas gradually becoming less buoyant and the Galerider was descending towards the jutting rock.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Now, Steg! Now!' bellowed the captain, his hands leaping from lever to bone-handled lever as he fought to keep the sky ship hovering motionless in place.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Steg Jambles didn't need telling twice. He tested the rope with a quick tug - just to be on the safe side - before stepping off the side of the ship. Tem and Ratbit took the strain and, when Steg had gathered himself, began turning the pulley-lever. Slowly, carefully, they lowered the thick-set fore-decker down through the air towards the jutting rock.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>At the balustrade, Maris gripped Quint's arm and turned to look up at him, her dark eyes glistening with a mixture of awe and excitement. Ever since Wind Jackal had plucked the pair of them away from Sanctaphrax those few short weeks earlier, she had seen so much: the snow-white desolation of the Mire, the treacherous glow of the Twilight Woods, the endless canopy of the Deepwoods from above - as well as the horrors of the slave market from which both the Stone Pilot and Tem Barkwater had been rescued. But this. . . this was the most chilling place they had visited so far, and she shivered with dread.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'The great void,' she murmured tremulously. 'The realm of ghosts and demons and . . . what was it your father said?'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Half-formed things,' said Quint, staring down at the fore-decker dangling below.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Stop!' Steg's bellowed command was just audible above the turbulent air.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Tem and Ratbit stopped turning the winch at once, and slid the locking bolt across. Far below, Steg gripped hold of a rough chunk of the jutting rock with one white-knuckled hand, while with the other, he unhooked the glinting rock-spike from his sky pirate coat.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'When you're ready, Master Steg!' Wind Jackal called out from the helm, battling to hold the ship steady, as the howling wind battered and buffeted it, seemingly from all sides at once. &nbsp; Steg thrust the pointed end of the spur into a narrow crack in the rock then, with a great round-bowled hammer that he'd unhooked from his belt, he pounded the spike into place with a flurry of colossal blows. As the sound of Steg's hammer blows rose up from below, Wind Jackal smiled grimly.</p><h2>The Celts: The People Who Came Out of the Darkness (English and German Edition)</h2><p>Recounts the sweeping two-thousand-year history of the people whose culture came to rival Greece&#39;s and Rome&#39;s and whose influence was felt from Asia Minor to Ireland</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Koi (Complete Pet Owner&#39;s Manual)</h2><p>In Japan, breeding Koi - a colorful fish in the carp family - is an art form.

The former steps forth, and proclaims his readiness to march.<br><br> -Major General Andrew Jackson<br><br> On June 1, 1812, America declared war. After a hot debate, James Madison's war resolution was passed by a vote of 19-13 in the Senate and 79-49 in the House of Representatives, and, once again, the new nation would be taking on the world's premier military and economic power: Great Britain.<br><br> Twenty-nine years had passed since the colonists' improbable victory in the Revolutionary War, and for twenty-nine years the British had failed to respect American sovereignty. Now, the nation James Madison led had reached the limit of its tolerance. Great Britain's kidnapping of American sailors and stirring up of Indian tribes to attack settlers on the western frontier had made life intolerably difficult for many of America's second generation, including those hardscrabble men and women pushing the boundaries westward.<br><br> Though reluctant to risk the new nation's liberty, Madison was now ready to send a message to England and the world that America would stand up to the bully that chose to do her harm. The unanswered question was: Could America win? Less than thirty years removed from the last war, and with virtually no national army, were Americans prepared to take on Britain and defend themselves, this time without the help of France? The world was about to find out.<br><br> In fact, so many Americans opposed the war that the declaration posed a real risk to the country's national unity. The Federalist Party, mainly representing northerners whose economy relied on British trade, had unanimously opposed the war declaration. Many New Englanders wanted peace with Britain, and it was likely that some would even be willing to leave the Union in order to avoid a fight.<br><br> Yet peaceful attempts at resolving the conflict with Britain had already been tried-and hadn't helped the economy much. Five years earlier, when a British ship attacked the U.S. Navy's Chesapeake, killing three sailors and taking four others from the ship to impress them into service to the Crown, then president Thomas Jefferson had attempted to retaliate. To protest this blatant hostility, Congress passed the Embargo Act, prohibiting overseas trade with Great Britain. Unfortunately, the act hurt Americans more than the British. In just fifteen months, the embargo produced a depression that cruelly punished merchants and farmers while doing little to deter the Royal Navy's interference and hardening New England's resistance to conflict. Further attempts at legislative pressure in the early years of James Madison's presidency had little effect, and British impressment had continued. By the time of the war declaration in June 1812, the number of sailors seized off the decks of American ships had risen to more than five thousand men.<br><br> To many, including Andrew Jackson, then forty years old, the attack on the Chesapeake alone had been an insult to American pride that demanded a military response. As Jackson wrote to a Virginia friend after learning of the Chesapeake's fate, "The degradation offered to our government . . . has roused every feeling of the American heart, and war with that nation is inevitable."<br><br> Yet America had waited, and the losses at sea mounted. At the same time, attempts to pacify the British had only resulted in further losses in America's new territory, "the West," which ran south to north from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada, bounded on the west by the Mississippi. There British agents were said to be agitating the Indians. For many years, the Five Civilized Tribes in the region (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole) had maintained peaceful relations with the European arrivals. But as more and more white settlers moved into native territories, tensions had risen and open conflict had broken out. In some places, travelers could no longer be certain whether the Native Americans they encountered were friendly; for inhabitants of the frontier, that meant the events of daily life were accompanied by fear. Stories circulated of fathers who returned from a day of hunting to find their children butchered, and of wives who stumbled upon their husbands scalped in the fields.<br><br> A major Shawnee uprising in the Indiana Territory in 1811 escalated the fear. And as the bloodshed increased, there were reports that the British were providing the Indians with weapons and promising them land if they carried out violent raids against American settlers. For Andrew Jackson, the threat had become too close for comfort when, in the spring of 1812, just a hundred miles from his home, a marauding band of Creeks killed six settlers and took a woman hostage. Jackson was certain the British were behind the attack on the little settlement at the mouth of the Duck River.<br><br> Westerners like Jackson fumed at the government's inability to resolve the country's problems, but their clout in Washington was limited. The decision makers from Virginia and New England had little sympathy for their inland countrymen. Eastern newspapers poked fun at the hill folks' backward ways, and much of the territory west of the Appalachian Mountains remained mysterious and wild, with few good roads and even fewer maps. The dangers faced by westerners were not felt by easterners, and their anguished demands for retaliation were scorned and dismissed by those whose wallets would be hurt by the war.<br><br> But eventually, despite many politicians' disdain for their hick neighbors to the west, Washington politics had begun to shift along with the nation's growing population. The West had gained new influence in the elections of 1810 and 1811, when the region sent a spirited band of new representatives to the Capitol. These men saw British attitudes toward the United States as a threat to American liberty and independence; they also saw the need for westward expansion, a move that the British were trying to thwart. Led by a young Kentuckian named Henry Clay, they quickly gained the nickname War Hawks, because, despite the risks, they knew it was time to fight.<br><br> Clay became Speaker of the House and he, along with the War Hawks and like-minded Republicans from the coastal states, put pressure on the Madison administration. Now, after years of resistance, Madison listened, and with Congress's vote, the War of 1812 began. America decided to stand up for its sovereignty on the sea and its security in the West.<br><br> The War Hawks in Washington were ecstatic about the declaration of war, and so was Jackson in Tennessee. At last he would have the chance to defend the nation he loved, to protect his family and friends-and, personally, to take revenge on the nation that had left him alone and scarred so many years before.<br><br> The Boy Becomes a Man<br><br> A quarter century before, Jackson had swallowed his grudge. When the Treaty of Paris made U.S. independence official in 1783, the orphaned sixteen-year-old adopted America as his family.<br><br> Relatives had taken him in after his mother's death. He became a saddler's apprentice, then, his ambitions rising, he clerked for a North Carolina attorney. Andrew Jackson's cobbled-together upbringing would serve him well, though he also gained a reputation as a young man who loved drinking, playing cards, and horse racing.<br><br> Admitted to the bar to practice law at age twenty, a year later he accepted an appointment as a public prosecutor in North Carolina's western district. That took him beyond the boundaries of the state, to the other side of the Appalachians. Jackson arrived in a region that, a few years after his arrival, became the state of Tennessee.<br><br> The red-haired, blue-eyed, and rangy six-foot-one young man made an immediate impression in Nashville, a frontier outpost established just eight years earlier. As Jackson put down roots, he became one of its chief citizens as his and his city's reputations grew. His rise gained momentum after he met Rachel Donelson, the youngest daughter of one of Nashville's founding families. Dark-eyed Rachel was the prettiest of the Donelson sisters and full of life. It was said she was "the best story-teller, the best dancer, . . . [and] the most dashing horsewoman in the western country." Jackson was smitten, and after she extricated herself from a marriage already gone bad, he took her as his wife.<br><br> As a lawyer, a trader, and a merchant, Jackson bought and sold land. By the time Tennessee joined the Union, in 1796, he had won the respect of his neighbors, who chose him as their delegate to the state's constitutional convention. Jackson then served as Tennessee's first congressman for one session before becoming a U.S. senator. But he found life in the political realm of the Federal City frustrating-too little got done for the decisive young Jackson-and he accepted an appointment to Tennessee's Supreme Court. In the early years of the nineteenth century, he divided his energies between administering the law and establishing himself at his growing plantation, the Hermitage, ten miles outside Nashville. "His house was the seat of hospitality," wrote a young officer friend, "the resort of friends and acquaintances, and of all strangers visiting the state."<br><br> His next venture into public service would suit him better: thanks to his strong relationships and sound political instincts, he was elected major general of the Tennessee militia, in February 1802. Maintained by the state, not the federal government, the militia was provisioned by local men who supplied their own weapons and uniforms and served short contracts of a few months' duration. Leading the militia was a good fit for Jackson's style, because it gave him the chance to serve the people he loved with the freedom he needed and the challenge he craved.<br><br> General Jackson repeatedly won reelection as well as the deep loyalty of his men. They liked what he said. He was often outspoken, and many shared his uncompromising views on defending settlers' rights. With rumors of war, he was ready to defend his people and was just the man to rally westerners to the cause of American liberty. "Citizens!" he wrote in a broadside. "Your government has at last yielded to the impulse of a nation. . . . Are we the titled slaves of George the Third? The military conscripts of Napoleon the great? Or the frozen peasants of the Russian czar? No-we are the free-born sons of America; the citizens of the only republic now existing in the world."<br><br> Jackson understood the stakes of the war, and he recognized the strategy as only a westerner could. Of critical importance to victory in the West was a port city near the Gulf Coast. As Jackson would soon say to his troops, in the autumn of 1812, "Every man of the western country turns his eyes intuitively upon the mouth of the Mississippi." Together, he observed, "[we are] committed by nature herself [to] the defense of the lower Mississippi and the city of New Orleans."<br><br> The City of New Orleans<br><br> New Orleans was important-so important, in fact, that upon becoming president a dozen years earlier, Thomas Jefferson had made acquiring it a key objective. Recognizing the city's singular strategic importance to his young nation, he wrote, "There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans."<br><br> Knowing that Napoleon's plan for extending his American empire had suffered a major setback in the Caribbean, where his expeditionary force had been decimated by yellow fever, Jefferson sensed an opportunity. He dispatched his friend James Monroe to Paris, instructing him to try to purchase New Orleans.<br><br> Monroe had succeeded in his assignment beyond Jefferson's wildest dreams. Recognizing his resources were already overextended in his quest to dominate Europe, Napoleon agreed to sell all of Louisiana. That conveyed an immense wilderness to the United States, effectively doubling the size of the new country. The Louisiana Purchase had been completed in 1803 and, at a purchase price of $15 million for more than eight hundred thousand square miles of territory, the land had been a staggering bargain (the cost to America's treasury worked out to less than three cents an acre).<br><br> The Louisiana city of New Orleans was the great gateway to and from the heart of the country. America's inland waterways-the Ohio, the Missouri, and the numerous other rivers that emptied into the Mississippi-amounted to an economic lifeline for farmers, trappers, and lumbermen upstream. On these waters flatboats and keelboats were a common sight, carrying manufactured goods from Pennsylvania, as well as crops, pelts, and logs from the burgeoning farms and lush forests across the Ohio Valley, Cumberland Gap, and Great Smoky Mountains. On reaching the wharves, warehouses, and quays of New Orleans, the goods went aboard waiting ships to be transported all over the world.<br><br> Although Louisiana became a state in April 1812, the British still questioned the legitimacy of America's ownership of the Louisiana Territory-Napoleon had taken Louisiana from Spain and, to some Europeans, it remained rightfully a possession of the Spanish Crown. Jackson feared that sort of thinking could provide the British with just the pretext they needed to interfere with the American experiment-capturing New Orleans would be the perfect way to disrupt America's western expansion.<br><br> Now that America had finally gone to war, many nagging practical questions hung in the air in Washington. Who would determine America's military strategy? Who would lead the nation to war? The generals of the revolutionary generation were aging or dead. The passing of George Washington had sent the nation into mourning thirteen years before, and no military leader had the stature to take the general's place. Although the country had prevailed in the previous decade in a war on the Barbary Coast of North Africa, defeating pirate states that had attacked its shipping and held its men hostage, this was a bigger fight for even bigger stakes.<br><br> Although neither Mr. Madison nor the members of Congress could know it in June 1812, the burden of protecting the West would eventually settle onto the narrow but resilient shoulders of General Andrew Jackson, a man little known and less liked outside his region. But first Jackson had to convince the men in Washington that a general from the backwoods was the one to lead the fight. That would be anything but easy.<br><br> Chapter 2<br><br> How to Lose a War<br><br> Resolved, that we consider the war commenced against Great Britain under existing circumstances unnecessary, impolitic and ruinous.<br><br> - Citizens of Lincoln County, Maine, August 3, 1812<br><br> The Boston Evening Post soon dubbed the conflict "Mr. Madison's War." With no template to follow-he was the first American president ever to sign a formal declaration of war-James Madison was largely on his own.<br><br> There was nothing battle-hardened about Madison. Soft-spoken as well as short, he weighed perhaps 120 pounds. Genteel in manner, he was sickly and bookish, with a face that bore the age lines of a man of sixty-one years. He was a far cry from the strategist George Washington had been and had little choice when it came to military matters but to rely on the advice of his counselors. Many of them also lacked war experience.</p><h2>The Reckoning</h2><p>Years after their disappearance, the children taken from their small town by an unknown being return to their families, unaged and wearing the same clothes they wore when they disappeared.

During the 1920s and 30s, Potamkin was one of the most acute critics of the arts in America. In a period when the general run of Marxist criticism was shallow and immature, he was developing in his discussion of the moving picture a critical apparatus which was to be of inestimable value to the critics who were to come after him. Unfortunately, the character of the Left press at that time prevented him from being widely published as a poet. Had this not been the case he might have devoted himself more entirely to poetry. The promise that is apparent in his few published poems might have been fulfilled.<br><br> However, Potamkin died in 1932 of an illness which was the direct result of semi-starvation. His funeral was a mass demonstration. Hundreds of the common people of New York attended to honor a spokesman whom they had loved and respected. Small-minded intellectuals who had accused him of obscurity, who had called him a metaphysician, who had said he was incomprehensible to the workers, were dumbfounded at his popularity.</p><p></p><h2>Waterloo in 100 Objects</h2><p><p><b>From bullet-pierced armor, skeletons of horses, medals, coins, and teeth of deceased soldiers&#x2014;a rich trove of Waterloo treasure survives 200 years on</b></p>Objects allow us to reach out and touch the past and they play a living role in history today. Through them we can come closer to the reality experienced by the soldiers who fought at Waterloo&#x2014;that most iconic of all battles. Using stunning photography, rare objects from the Napoleonic era tell us their story of the battle. From the discomfort of the uniforms to the drama of the battle-drums echoing across the battlefield, by examining each object and its place in the Waterloo story, we reach a deeper understanding of what happened on the battlefield and its significance today. Gareth Glover takes us on a fascinating journey through 100 objects, from the rare to the memorable, in a unique testimony to the importance of the battle of Waterloo, 200 years on.</p><p><b>Gareth Glover </b>has studied the Napoleonic Wars for more than 30 years and has gained a reputation as the foremost authority on British archive material specializing in the Battle of Waterloo and the Peninsular War. He has brought more than 20 previously unpublished Napoleonic memoirs into the public domain.<b> Andrew Roberts&nbsp;</b>has written or edited 12 books, and appears regularly on radio and television around the world.&nbsp;</p><h2>Miroslav Tichy</h2><p>Few stories in the history of photography are as astonishing and as compelling as that of the octogenarian Czech photographer Miroslav Tichï¿½. With crude homemade cameras fashioned out of cardboard and duct tape, Tichï¿½ took several thousand pictures of the women of his Moravian hometown of Kyjov throughout the 1960s and '70s. These pictures of women going about their daily business are at once banal and extraordinary, transforming the ordinary moments of work and leisure into small epiphanies. Blurred and off-kilter, his photographs have a striking contemporaneity, resembling the early paintings of Gerhard Richter or the photographs of Sigmar Polke. Printed imperfectly and deliberately battered, they evince a surprising retrograde or even antimodernist feeling, which, in the context of the Cold War atmosphere of provincial Czechoslovakia, just before and after the liberalizing moment of the Prague Spring (1968), undoubtedly constituted a kind of oblique political provocation, a nose-thumbing response to the progressive realist perfectionism of official Soviet culture.<br><br>The catalogue Miroslav Tichï¿½ accompanies an exhibition of the same title at the International Center of Photography organized by Chief Curator Brian Wallis. Critical evaluations by Brian Wallis, Roman Buxbaum, Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, and Richard Prince introduce more than 250 plates and illustrations.</p><p></p><h2>Issues and Life Science</h2><p>For New condition books; You will be the first to open the book cover.

She is the author of several critically acclaimed cookbooks including <em>Baking With Julia.<em> Her recipes and articles have appeared in <em>The New York Times, Bon Appetit, Food &amp; Wine,</em> and <em>Elle.</em></em></em>The title suggests the unthinkable: superindulgence in fare that has often been considered a frippery. Waffles can seem, quite appealingly, the stuff of childhood kitchens and adult narcoleptic Sundays. But Greenspan, a food journalist, tries to move waffles into the culinary mainstream, where they can serve a purpose at almost any meal, and in between. She discusses proper equipment, appropriate pantry purchases, unusual dietary considerations and how waffles can accommodate them, and what to do with waffles made ahead of time--freeze and microwave, mainly. Then the waffles themselves, in many incarnations: whole-grain sourdough, rocky road, mustard, zucchini-cheddar, rhubarb, chocolate-amaretti. There is a tiramisu waffle, a lemon meringue waffle and a white chocolate-chip variant--all lavish, as expected. And Greenspan doesn't neglect the childish sweet-tooth: one chapter is entitled "Just for Kids." So while it still seems unlikely, at the end of all, that anyone will actually grill up waffles for every meal, that possibility, as Greenspan presents it, is a pungent fantasy. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Odd Girl Speaks Out: Girls Write about Bullies, Cliques, Popularity, and Jealousy</h2><p>The national bestseller Odd Girl Out exposed a hidden culture of cruelty that had always been quietly endured by American girls. As Rachel Simmons toured the country, these girls found their voices and spoke to her about their pain. They wanted to talk-and they weren't the only ones. Mothers, teachers, counselors, young professional women, even fathers, came to Rachel with heart-wrenching personal stories that could no longer be kept secret.<br> Here, Rachel creates a safe place for girls to talk, rant, sound off, and find each other. The result is a collection of wonderful accounts of the inner lives of adolescent girls. Candid and disarming, creative and expressive, and always exceptionally self-aware, these poems, songs, confessions, and essays form a journal of American girlhood.

The real identity of the person who chose to write under the pseudonym of Dionysius the Areopagite is unknown. Even the exact dates of his writings have never been determined. Moreover the texts themselves, though relatively short, are at points seemingly impenetrable and have mystified readers over the centuries. Yet the influence of this shadowy figure on broad range of mystical writers from the early middle ages on is readily discernible. His formulation of a method of negative theology that stresses the impotence of humans' attempt to penetrate the "cloud of unknowing" is famous as is his meditation on the divine names. <p>Despite his influence, relatively few attempts have been made to translate the entire corpus of his written into English. Here in one volume are collected all of the Pseudo-Dionysius' works. Each has been translated from the Migne edition, with reference to the forthcoming Gï¿½ttingen critical edition of A.M. Ritter, G. Heil, and B. Suchla. </p><p>To present these works to the English-speaking public, an outstanding team of six research scholars has been assembled. The lucid translation of Colm Luibheid has been augmented by Paul Rorem's notes and textual collaboration. The reader is presented a rich and varied examination of the main themes of Dionysian spirituality by Renï¿½ Roques, an incisive discussion of the original questions of the authenticity and alleged heresies in the Dionysian corpus by Jaroslav Pelikan, a comprehensive tracing Dionysius' influence on medieval authors by Jean Leclercq, and a survey by Karlfried Froehlich of the reception given the corpus by Humanists and sixteenth-century Reformers.</p></p><p>Text: English, Greek (translation)</p><h2>Step-By-Step Guide to Painting Realistic Watercolors</h2><p>Ten projects help artists achieve immediately gratifying results.

These were primarily boxes and frames in addition to small private altars, crosses, wall pockets, clock cases, plant stands, and even furniture. Whittling objects such as chains and ball-in-cage whimsies was a common hobby&#x2015;including among rail-riding &#x201c;hobos&#x201d;&#x2015;and for many years &#x201c;tramp art&#x201d; was believed to have been made by these itinerants as well. Although this notion has been widely dispelled, the name has stuck. In recent years efforts have been made to identify makers by name and reveal their stories. While some examples of tramp art may be attributed to itinerants, this carving style was more commonly a practice of working-class men creating functional objects for their households. No Idle Hands presents more than one hundred and fifty tramp art objects collected mainly from the United States and also including pieces from France, Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil&#x2015;demonstrating the far reach this art form has had. It includes works by contemporary artists, thus establishing tramp art as an ongoing folk art form rather than a vestige of the past. The pieces reproduced here reveal an artistic and intricate sensibility applied to each handcrafted piece. Essays consider assumptions about tramp art related to class, quality, and the anonymity of its makers and examine this practice through the lens of home and family while tracing its relationship to the tobacco industry. The book will cultivate an appreciation of an art form that is as thought-provoking as it is enduring.</p><p><strong>Laura M.

Stay cool.</em></p><p>No one knows exactly when it began or where it originated. A terrifying new plague is spreading like wildfire across the country, striking cities one by one: Boston, Detroit, Seattle. The doctors call it Draco Incendia Trychophyton. To everyone else it&#x2019;s Dragonscale, a highly contagious, deadly spore that marks its hosts with beautiful black and gold marks across their bodies&#x2014;before causing them to burst into flames. Millions are infected; blazes erupt everywhere. There is no antidote. No one is safe.</p><p>Harper Grayson, a compassionate, dedicated nurse as pragmatic as Mary Poppins, treated hundreds of infected patients before her hospital burned to the ground. Now she&#x2019;s discovered the telltale gold-flecked marks on her skin. When the outbreak first began, she and her husband, Jakob, had made a pact: they would take matters into their own hands if they became infected. To Jakob&#x2019;s dismay, Harper wants to live&#x2014;at least until the fetus she is carrying comes to term. At the hospital, she witnessed infected mothers give birth to healthy babies and believes hers will be fine too. . . if she can live long enough to deliver the child.</p><p>Convinced that his do-gooding wife has made him sick, Jakob becomes unhinged, and eventually abandons her as their placid New England community collapses in terror. The chaos gives rise to ruthless Cremation Squads&#x2014;armed, self-appointed posses roaming the streets and woods to exterminate those who they believe carry the spore.

At no point in Joe Hill&#x2019;s doorstop-weight novel did I have that urge, for each and every page had me entranced. Set in New Hampshire right about now, <em>The Fireman</em> opens with a man spontaneously combusting outside the office of school nurse Harper Grayson. He&#x2019;s not the first victim of <em>Draco incendia trychophyton</em>, the spore responsible for this transformation, but he&#x2019;s the signal that Dragonscale has spread to Harper&#x2019;s small town. It also spreads to Harper soon after she realizes she&#x2019;s pregnant. Highly contagious and 100 percent fatal, Dragonscale soon plunges the world into chaos. (An oddly affective moment is when Harper logs onto Google and finds, instead of the search engine, the words &#x201c;Goodby.&#x201d;) But Hill smartly focuses on Harper and her attempts at survival, keeping the stakes small but extremely personal as the uninfected hunt down and murder the infected, supposedly to protect the rest of the town but really to indulge in sociopathic tendencies now unleashed. <em>The Fireman</em> starts with a hot burn, simmers as Harper joins a group of infected hiding in a summer camp, and then heats up again as the near-utopian community ruptures. Hill weaves questions about the power of leadership, group-think, love, catastrophe, and family into the plot. His smartest move is to give no clear-cut answers to these questions, making <em>The Fireman</em> more substantial and real than a typical apocalyptic thriller. And his humdinger of an ending provides just the right closure. <em>--Adrian Liang</em><p>From the award-winning, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>NOS4A2, Horns</em>, and <em>Heart-Shaped Box</em> comes an unnerving novel about a worldwide pandemic of spontaneous combustion that threatens to reduce civilization to ashes </p><p>Stay cool . . .</p><p>No one knows exactly when or where it began. A terrifying new plague is spreading like wildfire across the country, striking cities one by one . . .

Caspar David Friedrich was a German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his time and one of the most original geniuses in the history of landscape painting. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world.</p><p></p><h2>Healthy Woman, Healthy Life: A Woman&#39;s Book of Healing</h2><p>In&nbsp;<i>Healthy Woman, Healthy Life</i>&nbsp;Gary Null updates and expands the topic of the first&nbsp;edition&nbsp;to feature the latest&nbsp;clinical experience and published research on issues important to women of all ages.

After 9/11, he was recalled to the United States, assigned to Task Force 500, and subsequently sent to Kandahar, Afghanistan. He ultimately supervised all military interrogations conducted at the theatre-wide detention facility at Bagram airfield. <p>Greg Miller is a national correspondent for the Los Angeles Times.</p>This fascinating memoir reports from one of the most crucial and controversial fronts in the war on terror. The pseudonymous Mackey was an interrogator at military prisons in Afghanistan, tasked with sussing out the secrets of suspected Taliban and al-Qaeda members. He and journalist Miller take readers inside the prison cells and interrogation rooms, where interrogators choreograph elaborate mind games and fight epic battles of will with their often formidable captives. Their account's full of the engrossing lore and procedure of interrogation, the thrust and parry of baited queries and cagey half-truths, and the occasional dramatic breakthrough when a prisoner cracks. But it also reveals the squalor and drudgery of the prison camps, the exhaustion, bad temper and frequent ineptitude of the interrogators and the many lapses in the American intelligence effort, especially by the CIA, which Mackey regards as an arrogant, secretive and incompetent organization. Mackey deplores the Abu Ghraib abuses and insists that his unit never violated the Geneva Conventions. They flirted, he acknowledges, with stress positions and sleep deprivation, but this was nothing, he claims, beyond what army recruits and the interrogators themselves routinely endured; their main weapons seem to have been veiled threats to return Arab prisoners to their homelands, where they would face real torture. The book, which was vetted by the Pentagon, will not settle the questions surrounding American treatment of prisoners in Iraq and elsewhere. But it does give a vivid, gritty look at the pressures and compromises attendant on this unconventional war. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Burke was at the wheel, driving toward a destination that wasn&#x2019;t even a point on a map. The instructions he was following were a list of distances and landmarks: they&#x2019;d crossed from Montana into North Dakota hours ago, but for all any of the four of them knew, their destination might be the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. <br> <i>It&#x2019;s Saturday morning,</i> Spirit thought wearily, feeling drunk from lack of sleep, as she gazed out the side window at the unchanging vista of fields and trees and distant mountains. It was spring&#x2014;almost April&#x2014;but the landscape looked barren to her. It was nothing like the place she&#x2019;d grown up. Her life was nothing like the one she&#x2019;d had the last time she&#x2019;d looked out a car window counting the weeks to summer. <br>Her life? It was an unreal nightmare, the stuff of B movies. Except it was happening, and it was almost uniformly horrible. <br>A year ago, Saturday had been a day to hang out with friends, to tease her younger sister, to make elaborate kitchen experiments with Dad or go on adventures with Mom. But that was before the&#x2014; <i>Don&#x2019;t call it an accident now, call it what it was. Murder.</i> Murder. Before the Shadow Knights murdered her family. Before everything changed. <br>Six months ago, she&#x2019;d just been told she was going to go to a place called Oakhurst because there was nowhere else for her to go with all her family dead. From the beginning, Spirit had known there was something <i>wrong</i> with Oakhurst. <i>Yeah, maybe the fact that someone was trying to kill us off might have been the hint</i>. But that was simplifying things; the facade that Oakhurst had kept up was too good. The whole horrible scope of how badly things were wrong had taken a while to figure out. In fact, it hadn&#x2019;t been until a week ago that she really understood, when she&#x2019;d gotten the last clues to put it all together. <br>She&#x2019;d been told when she arrived that Oakhurst wasn&#x2019;t a normal orphanage, but a school for magicians. Which had been unsettling, and scary, but could have been kind of cool if the people in charge hadn&#x2019;t been pitting every student against every other student, in a kind of just-sub-lethal Hunger Games. <br>But then she found out that if you had magic, Oakhurst&#x2019;s headmaster tracked you down and killed your family, and then made it look as if they&#x2019;d wanted you to be sent there. Loch&#x2019;s father had died in a hotel fire, Muirin&#x2019;s in an automobile accident, Addie&#x2019;s in a plane crash, Burke&#x2019;s in a home invasion. Hers, in another car crash. The method didn&#x2019;t matter. Only the results. That you got sent to Oakhurst, where the headmaster could decide if you were worth the effort of teaching. Because if he decided you weren&#x2019;t&#x2014;well, the Hunger Games stopped being <i>sub</i>-lethal. <br> <i>And I thought all along he&#x2019;d made a mistake about me, that I didn&#x2019;t have magic. But he hadn&#x2019;t.</i> She looked down at her hands. There was still a pale mark on the left one where her school ring had been. The stone changed color when it recognized your magic, and hers never had. <br>Until last night. <br> <i>And now I know I&#x2019;m a Spirit Mage, and I know my School of Magic is the School of Spirit, but that&#x2019;s all I know. They taught four Schools of Magic at Oakhurst. Dr. Ambrosius made everyone forget there were five.</i> <br>She didn&#x2019;t know why, but considering everything else, it almost didn&#x2019;t matter. Dr. Ambrosius wanted to bring everyone with magic to Oakhurst so he could either recruit them&#x2014;or kill them. Because in his world, there were only flunkies and enemies, and he wasn&#x2019;t just a magician. And his real name wasn&#x2019;t Ambrosius. <br>His real name was Mordred. <i>The</i> Mordred. Centuries ago, he&#x2019;d lost a war for a kingdom. His enemies had locked him in a prison they&#x2019;d hoped would last forever&#x2014;but just in case it didn&#x2019;t, his jailers had cast a second spell, binding all of them to be reborn over and over until the threat was ended forever. To become <i>Reincarnates,</i> unaware of who they&#x2019;d been until Merlin&#x2014;or Mordred&#x2014;awakened their memories. <br>Merlin. Mordred. Arthur. Guinevere. Names out of a storybook until Spirit and her friends discovered it wasn&#x2019;t a story&#x2014;it was something they were all living. Because Dr. Ambrosius was Mordred, and once he&#x2019;d escaped his prison, he gathered an army of Shadow Knights to serve him, and spent decades hunting the Grail Knights who were the only challengers to his power. <br>He built Oakhurst as the means to do that. He eliminated every magician who wouldn&#x2019;t serve him before they could even begin to threaten him. And who would ever have believed he was doing anything like that, when no one in the outside world had so much as a <i>clue</i> that magic was real? <br>A day ago, Spirit finally found a way for the five of them to escape from Oakhurst. If escape had been their only goal, there wouldn&#x2019;t have been any point&#x2014;but escape was only the beginning of what they were going to have to do. <br> <i>Save the world. Why is it that&#x2019;s always what it turns out to be?</i> <br>Maybe because when it was <i>things</i> like Mordred you were up against, they weren&#x2019;t going to settle for anything less than the world. <br>It was Muirin who&#x2019;d infiltrated the Shadow Knights to discover Mordred planned to trigger a nuclear apocalypse to create a world where Magic, not Science, ruled. They&#x2019;d fled knowing they were the only ones who had a chance to stop it. A mysterious ally Spirit knew only as QUERCUS had given them a place to go. <br>But escape had come at far too high a price. <br>The van hit another pothole, and Spirit groaned faintly. <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Burke said, glancing at her apologetically. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thinking about Muirin,&#x201d; she said. She closed her eyes hard, willing herself not to cry. It wouldn&#x2019;t do any good. Muirin would still be dead. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br> <i>Muirin clung to Doc Mac&#x2019;s arm as the dancers at the Spring Fling swirled around them, oblivious. She looked greenish-pale, and the dark smudges under her eyes had nothing to do with makeup. Spirit saw her lurch and stagger, and only Doc Mac&#x2019;s grip on her arm kept her from falling.</i> <br> <i>&#x201c;Muirin!&#x201d; Spirit cried.</i> <br> <i>She pushed through the crowd, shoving people out of her way as she headed for Muirin. She was about halfway there when Muirin saw her. She brought her hand up and made a throwing motion. The car keys came flying through the air, and Spirit snatched them without thought. Muirin silently mouthed one word:</i> <br> <i>&#x201c;Run.&#x201d;</i> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Not everyone with magic was a Reincarnate, but Spirit had been sure about Muirin. Anastus Ovcharenko&#x2014;Shadow Knight and Mordred&#x2019;s pet assassin&#x2014;had called Muirin and Madison Lane-Rider &#x201c;sisters&#x201d;&#x2014;and that made Madison Lane-Rider Queen Morgause and Muirin Queen Morgaine. Madison was a Shadow Knight, and Muirin had played a long double game, pretending she wanted to join them while remaining loyal to her friends. Maybe Murr-cat had been tempted to swap sides&#x2014;maybe she&#x2019;d even come close, and who could have blamed her? The other side had&nbsp;&#x2026; everything. What did her friends have? But Muirin had stuck with them. Without Muirin&#x2019;s last-minute warning&#x2014;without her <i>help</i>&#x2014;Mordred would have gotten all five of them. <br>Instead of only one of them. <br>Burke reached out a hand and closed it over hers. &#x201c;They will pay for that. I swear it,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;Do you think&#x2014;?&#x201d; she said, hating herself for hoping. She&#x2019;d seen Muirin fall, shot by Anastus Ovcharenko&#x2014;Prince Agravaine. But maybe.&#x2026; <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Burke said quietly. &#x201c;They&#x2019;d never have trusted her after she helped us. He shot to kill.&#x201d; <br> <i>I won&#x2019;t cry,</i> Spirit told herself desperately, but despite her best efforts, a tear slid down her cheek. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s no sin to grieve,&#x201d; Burke said gently. <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have time,&#x201d; Spirit answered angrily. &#x201c;Mordred&#x2019;s going to nuke the world back to the Stone Age!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We have time to mourn for our friend. Mordred moves on Beltane,&#x201d; Burke said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s May first. It&#x2019;s only the end of March now.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Great,&#x201d; Spirit said, rubbing her eyes, her throat and heart aching. &#x201c;Six weeks to save the world.&#x201d; <br>Silence hung between them, stretching the tension to the breaking point. &#x201c;I hope this Internet buddy of yours can help,&#x201d; Burke finally said, awkwardly changing the subject. <br>She took the change of subject gratefully, thankful for his kindness. &#x201c;Me, too,&#x201d; Spirit answered somberly. <br>&#x201c;Are we there yet?&#x201d; Loch asked, sitting up and leaning forward between the seats. He and Addie were riding in the back. Spirit could have ridden in back too, and maybe even gotten some sleep&#x2014;QUERCUS had left the van for them, along with the directions to reach their destination&#x2014;but she&#x2019;d wanted to be with Burke. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make me pull this getaway car over,&#x201d; Burke said lightly, and despite everything, Spirit smiled. <br>She&#x2019;d never had a boyfriend before. She&#x2019;d never expected to find one at Oakhurst. After her family died, she&#x2019;d just wanted to shut out the world, and never care about anyone again. But Burke had loved her&#x2014;as simply and as uncomplicatedly as breathing&#x2014;from almost the moment he&#x2019;d first seen her. When she&#x2019;d realized she was in love with him too, it was too late to turn back and pretend she wasn&#x2019;t. It was the most wonderful thing in her life. It was the most terrible thing too, because she&#x2019;d known they were all in danger before the first time Burke had kissed her, and the thought she could lose him the way she&#x2019;d lost her family was terrifying. <br>To lose anyone else, really, and she&#x2019;d already lost Muirin, and she knew it hadn&#x2019;t really sunk in yet, but it already hurt so much she just wanted to scream until she couldn&#x2019;t scream any more. <br>&#x201c;Are we going to be awake now?&#x201d; Addie asked grumpily, sitting up next to Loch. She glanced out the windshield. &#x201c;Ugh. It looks the same as it did the last time I looked. Where are we going?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, but we&#x2019;re making good time,&#x201d; Burke joked. <br>They were all concentrating on trivial stuff, or trying to, and Spirit didn&#x2019;t blame them. Easier not to talk about the danger, the deaths, the fact they weren&#x2019;t safe, even now. &#x201c;Wherever it is, we should be there in a couple of hours, tops,&#x201d; Spirit said, waving the sheaf of directions. &#x201c;According to this, anyway.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I hope wherever it is it involves thick walls and strong doors,&#x201d; Loch said. &#x201c;And maybe landmines. Because I&#x2019;m pretty sure Breakthrough isn&#x2019;t going to stop chasing us.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not if Mordred wants them to,&#x201d; Addie said, shuddering. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t want to be the one he got mad at.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Except you totally are,&#x201d; Loch pointed out. &#x201c;We all are.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Burke said reasonably. &#x201c;But at least we can run for our lives. I wouldn&#x2019;t want to be one of his henchmen.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think <i>Mark</i> wants to be one of his henchmen right now, either,&#x201d; Addie said. <br>&#x201c;Too bad,&#x201d; Spirit said venomously. &#x201c;He had the same choice everyone else got, and he chose Mordred.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, cake or death, great choice,&#x201d; Loch said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not excusing him&#x2014;his so-called &#x2018;security people&#x2019; killed our families, as I&#x2019;m sure we all remember&#x2014;but he probably never expected the Evil Overlord&#x2019;s plan to be starting a nuclear war just so he didn&#x2019;t have to deal with the real world.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t make <i>sense</i>,&#x201d; Addie said plaintively. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a magician&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve all seen how much power he has. Mordred could probably have taken over a country and made himself king years ago. There are thousands of places where if you walked in and said you could cure disease and make the crops grow and could prove it, they&#x2019;d fall all over themselves to hand you the keys to the kingdom.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So to speak,&#x201d; Loch said, with a wry smile. &#x201c;Stubborn and stupid is a bad combination, but he&#x2019;s just like a lot of CEOs my father dealt with. And remember&#x2014;Mordred isn&#x2019;t a Reincarnate.&#x201d; <br>Suddenly, some of this made a twisted sort of sense to Spirit. Mordred had been Mordred for centuries. He&#x2019;d never been anyone else. He still thought like a Dark Age tyrant. After all this time, he was probably crazier than a cageful of bats, too, but everything he was, everything he defaulted to, was the man who&#x2019;d been born in a time when a state-of-the-art weapon was a steel sword or a powerful magician. Maybe he really didn&#x2019;t comprehend what a nuclear war would <i>do</i> to the world. Maybe he just thought of it as burned crops, leveled cities, and poisoned wells on a mass scale. <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s still Mordred,&#x201d; Spirit said, realizing. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s never been anyone else. Not like the others.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not like us,&#x201d; Burke said. <br>Spirit looked at him in surprise. &#x201c;Us?&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;Reincarnates?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on,&#x201d; Loch said. &#x201c;The odds are at least <i>one</i> of us is a former <i>Knight Who Says Ni.</i>&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Besides Muirin,&#x201d; Addie said quietly. <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Burke said, and after that nobody said anything for a while. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; Addie said, pulling the van to a halt. <br>It was a little after noon. Loch had taken over from Burke, and Addie from Loch: Spirit was the only one who didn&#x2019;t know how to drive, and seeing the weariness on her friends&#x2019; faces that made her feel guilty now. They&#x2019;d all been awake over twenty-four hours, and to add driving to that.&#x2026; <br>&#x201c;Not where I&#x2019;d choose to make my last stand,&#x201d; Loch said, looking around the parking lot and back at the seedy strip motel. <br>They&#x2019;d been seeing signs for Omaha for a while&#x2014;that and Offutt Air Force Base&#x2014;but where their directions had led them was to a middle-of-nowhere place that was barely a wide spot in the road: gas station, motel, diner. If there was a town anywhere nearby, or even some random houses, they weren&#x2019;t visible from the Alvo Motor Hotel. There wasn&#x2019;t even a McDonald&#x2019;s. <br>&#x201c;Well, there aren&#x2019;t any more directions,&#x201d; Addie said, waving the last sheet of paper. &#x201c;But.&#x2026; We aren&#x2019;t that far from Omaha.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This is where QUERCUS sent us,&#x201d; Spirit said reluctantly. &#x201c;This is where he&#x2019;ll expect to find us.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And what then? What do we do then?&#x201d; Addie asked, a little shrilly. &#x201c;Is he going to hand us a magic sword? Or turn us into superheroes? Sure, we&#x2019;ve got magic&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve <i>all</i> got magic&#x2014;but so do they.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Spirit said softly. Addie had always doubted their ability&#x2014;her <i>own</i> ability&#x2014;to fight back, and Spirit really couldn&#x2019;t blame her. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t know what else to do.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And we&#x2019;re all just about out on our feet,&#x201d; Burke said. &#x201c;We aren&#x2019;t going anywhere except off the side of the road if we don&#x2019;t get some rest. If this is our only option, well, it&#x2019;s our only option.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So let&#x2019;s go see what&#x2019;s behind Door Number Six,&#x201d; Loch said. <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go find out if it&#x2019;s locked,&#x201d; Addie said pragmatically. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Spirit blinked at the brightness of the sunlight as she stepped out of the van. Her shoes&#x2014;the strappy silver sandals Madison Lane-Rider had picked out as part of her Spring Fling outfit&#x2014;slid on the asphalt, and she grabbed for the doorframe. <br>&#x201c;Easy,&#x201d; Burke said, putting a hand under her arm. <br>The coat QUERCUS had left for him in the van hung open; the tuxedo beneath it looked jarringly out of place. They were all still wearing their prom clothes under their coats, but at least Spirit&#x2019;s dress was short. Addie was wearing an ankle-length velvet gown; it caught on something as she slid out of the driver&#x2019;s seat, and Spirit heard her snarl as she ripped it free and slammed the door as hard as she could. <br>&#x201c;At this point I don&#x2019;t actually care if the Legions of Hell are in there,&#x201d; Loch said, slamming the back door of the van, &#x201c;as long as I can sit down somewhere that isn&#x2019;t moving.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; Burke said.

Contemporary cozies don&amp;'t get much better than Agatha-winner Malliet&amp;'s third Max Tudor mystery (after 2012&amp;'s A Fatal Winter). A former MI5 agent turned Anglican vicar, Tudor has made a new beginning in the English village of Nether Monkslip, where he&amp;'s been fortunate enough to find the love of his life, Awena Owen, though her religious views quite differ from his own. Tudor once again slips into sleuthing mode after a mysterious death following a dinner honoring playwright and actor Thaddeus Bottle, who recently retired with his wife to Nether Monkslip, his boyhood home. Familiar elements include a polarizing figure whom many wish ill, the planting of red herrings, and a well-clued solution, but Malliet isn&amp;'t content simply to update the golden age template. Between her unusual lead, his love interest, and the other village residents, she&amp;'s created well-thought-out characters who are much more than stereotypes, and has added plenty of wry humor to boot.

There is one for each of the five step-by-step demonstrations, plus a bonus tracing of the inspirational painting in tonhe Introduction secti. Dani Humberstone is a successful abstract artist who uses the tracings in innovative, imaginative way. Follow here in-depth step-by-step instrcutions to produce your own wonderful piece of abstract art.</p><p>Dani was born in London and educated at Michael Hall School in East Sussex. She trained as a fashion designer in Brighton and developed an award-winning design business, before working in graphic design and book illustration for a number of varied clients, including nightclubs, magazines, offices and schools. As well as producing greetings cards used worldwide, working as a freelance gallery manager and curator and sitting on the board of a prestigious Sussex based fine art exhibition, DanI has been a professional artist for ten years and exhibited in galleries, art fairs and group exhibitions. She works from her art shop/studio on the High Street in Wadhurst, East Sussex.I&#39;m a great fan of the ready to paint series - for those who are somewhat fearful of applying paint to paper and of getting the drawing right these take all the worry away and allow the budding artist to create a work with confidence and of course once that hurdle is over the can use the tracings to devise their won colour schemes and gradually built self-assurance and create their won artworks. Its the first step that&#39;s often the hardest, and the tracings take away that fear. Now applying the concept to abstract seems odd to me. Chatting to a friend however she pointed out that while i&#39;m happy to throw paint around, ( yep -throw, that&#39;s right - you should see the shed windows sometimes...) let colours drip and merge and add in anything to hand such as paper , straw, feathers and see what develops, some people feel intimidated by abstracts so i looked at this book in a different light to see what it has to offer those who want to approach abstract but don&#39;t know or are fearful of starting. I discovered that the trace outs can have the same usefulness as with those of more realistic artworks - they can be used and colours copied, then the students own colours substituted and confidence is built up over time. So beginning with Venetian bubbles, inspired by bright murano glass the first image is based around primary colours and simple squares, rectangles and bubbles and has quite a structured approach moving on to a similar work but slightly looser, an interpretation of Barcelona. This time the same basic shapes are used but with different colours and the addition of some metallic leaf ( i love that stuff!) Dani then moves on to an interpretive landscape in vibrant blues and reds painted over texture medium, one titled fire and Ice which is moving towards less structure and more visualisation and finally onto freestyle where the basic trace out is there but the end result is made up by the student. So having wondered what on earth this was about I&#39;ve found that actually for those people who hesitate and yet want to loosen their work and move into Abstraction this book will prove extremely useful. If this is you, or a friend and you find your arm hovering tentatively with a drop of paint on the brush but you don&#39;t know where to put it - buy this book.

A father determined to rescue his son. One of the most remarkable and moving true stories of faith and perseverance to come out of World War II.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <i>October 6, 1944. </i>Twenty-year-old Army Air Corps Second Lieutenant David &#x201c;Mac&#x201d; Warren MacArthur was on a strafing mission over Greece when a round of 88-mm German anti-aircraft flak turned his P-38 Lightning into a comet of fire and smoke. Dave parachuted to safety as the Lightning lived up to her name and struck the Adriatic Sea like a bolt of flames. In minutes, he was plucked from the water&#x2014;only to find himself on the wrong end of a German rifle pointing straight at his head.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dave&#x2019;s father, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughn MacArthur, was a chaplain with the 8th Armored Division of Patton&#x2019;s Third Army when he learned of his son&#x2019;s capture.

Then in May 1945, Vaughn&#x2019;s last hope was Stalag VII-A in Moosburg, Germany. Through the barbed wire fence, he cried out his son&#x2019;s name.

She lives in Pismo Beach, California.<br>This excellent collection brings together 14 of Baker's short stories about "The Company," three of them unpublished. Select humans have been plucked from various epochs and turned into enhanced, immortal, time-traveling cyborgs, programmed to do the shadowy bidding of the profit-loving Company. Unable to fight their own programming, the best of them try to fulfill the Company's directives while being kind to the mortal "sheep" they live among ("Noble Mold" and "Studio Dick Drowns Near Malibu"). Their jobs and lives are complicated by warring Company factions ("Old Flat Top"), which certain mortals see as heavenly battles ("The Hotel at Harlan's Landing"). Also included are the first four tales about the mysterious, genetically enhanced Alec Checkerfield ("Smart Alec," "The Dust Enclosed Here," "Monster Story" and "The Likely Lad"), as well as two other stories ("The Literary Agent" and "The Wreck of the Gladstone") that obliquely pertain to his origins and influences. Baker shows greater range with these stories than she does in her novels (In the Garden of Eden, etc.), and has more fun with her characters, letting them play at being pirates, dig up mummies or interact with Shakespeare and Robert Louis Stevenson. Though the collection brings up troubling ethical questions about the nature of the author's future history (since Alec is referred to as Adonai, does that mean he is God?), Baker masterfully handles characters and plots.

Engaging the Struggles of Your Heart, the second series in the Walking Toward Eternity Program, is a challenging study that can open our eyes to obstacles in our Christian walk such as greed, envy, fear and shame. Through prayer, reflection, guidance, and the aid of the Holy Spirit, we begin to engage these difficulties in a positive way as we continue toward our goal of union with Christ.

You will learn how to engage your: Appetites, Shame, Envy, Anger, Fear, Loneliness and Hopelessness.</p><p></p><h2>Between the hammer and the sickle: Across Russia by cycle</h2><p>After negotiating with the Soviet authorities for one and a half years, Simon Vickers, together with three others, secured permission to cross the USSR with a freedom undreamt of since before 1917. Sensing that the current era of glasnost might be short-lived, they took advantage of the first - and possibly the last - such opportunity to gain an insight into a world divorced from Europe for so long. They decided to make their trip by bicycle, from Leningrad to Vladivostock. In their gruelling 12,000 kilometers journey, they crossed Russia, Kazakhstan and Siberia, spending three months alone in Siberia where black bears roam wild. The differences in national character of the British, French, American and Russian team members add a diverting element to this story of their six-months journey, which took them across ten time zones, from the Baltic to the Pacific. What makes it particularly extraordinary is the account of their daily contact with Soviet citizens, many of whom had never met Europeans before. Frequently guests in Soviet homes, they gained a true insight into their lives, hopes and fears. Through conversations the travellers had on these encounters, a picture of Russia emerges which is different from both their expectations and the picture we have of it in the West. This is an account of a country in turmoil, trying to come to terms with its history, and in many ways remaining curiously unchanged.</p><p></p><h2>Cat&#39;s Cradle: Time&#39;s Crucible (The New Doctor Who Adventures)</h2><p>THIS STORY FEATURES THE DOCTOR&#39;S 7TH INCARNATION (played on TV by Sylvester McCoy) AND HIS FINAL COMPANION (of the orig. series), ACE. &#34;Time&#39;s Crucible&#34; is the 1st adventure in the 3-volume Cat&#39;s Cradle series.

This is only one of the &#34;extraordinary popular delusions&#34; documented by Mackay in a fascinating study of group psychology. He also describes notorious witch hunts, haunted houses, the Crusades, beliefs in fortunetellers and in the magical power of alchemy, veneration of relics, bogus health cures and health scares, and many other examples of human credulity and flights from reason. This work is a true classic in the study of paranormal beliefs, a funny, shocking, and unbelievable yet true history of human gullibility.</p><p>Why do otherwise intelligent individuals form seething masses of idiocy when they engage in collective action? Why do financially sensible people jump lemming-like into hare-brained speculative frenzies--only to jump broker-like out of windows when their fantasies dissolve? We may think that the Great Crash of 1929, junk bonds of the '80s, and over-valued high-tech stocks of the '90s are peculiarly 20th century aberrations, but Mackay's classic--first published in 1841--shows that the madness and confusion of crowds knows no limits, and has no temporal bounds. These are extraordinarily illuminating,and, unfortunately, entertaining tales of chicanery, greed and naivete. Essential reading for any student of human nature or the transmission of ideas. <p> </p><p> In fact, cases such as Tulipomania in 1624--when Tulip bulbs traded at a higher price than gold--suggest the existence of what I would dub "Mackay's Law of Mass Action:" when it comes to the effect of social behavior on the intelligence of individuals, 1+1 is often less than 2, and sometimes considerably less than 0.</p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia Minor</h2><p>The law collections presented in this volume are compilations, varying in legal and literary sophistication, recorded by scribes in the schools and the royal centers of ancient Mesopotamian and Asia Minor from the end of the third millennium through the middle of the first millennium B.C.E. Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, and Hittite texts, with accompanying English translations, are included. Some of the collections, like the famous Laws of Hammurabi, achieved a wide audience; others, like the Laws about Rented Oxen, were scribal exercises limited to a local school center. All, however, reflected contemporary legal practice in the scribes&#39; recordings of contracts, administrative documents, and court cases and also provide historians with evidence of abstractions of legal rules from specific cases. In addition to the texts and translations, the volume includes a list of sources, bibliography, glossary, and numerous indexes.</p><p>Text: English, Greek, Hebrew...a must for students interested in the ancient Near East and law. --<i>Religious Studies Review</i><br><br>...highly recommended to every student of the Bible and the ancient Near East. --<i>Journal of Semitic Studies</i></p><h2>On the Curve: The Life and Art of Sybil Andrews</h2><p><p>Sybil Andrews was one of Canada&#x2019;s most prominent artists working throughout the late twentieth century. From a cottage by the sea in Campbell River, Andrews created striking linocut prints steeped in feeling and full of movement. Inspired by the working-class community that she lived in, her art is known for its honest depiction of ordinary people at work and play on Canada&#x2019;s West Coast. &nbsp;<br><br> Although she was raised in Bury St Edmunds, England, <i>On the Curve </i>focuses on Andrews&#x2019; life after she immigrated to Canada in 1947. Settling in Campbell River, Andrews taught private art and music lessons and created artwork that gained her recognition across the globe. In the final years of her life, retrospective exhibitions of her prints in Canada and Britain skyrocketed her popularity. Prints of her artwork became even more valuable after her death in 1992. In this first fully illustrated biography, author Janet Nicol weaves together stories from Andrews&#x2019; letters, diaries and interviews from her former students and friends, creating a portrait of this determined, resilient and gifted British-Canadian artist. Andrews&#x2019; work is as popular today as it was in her lifetime and continues to celebrate the cultural, industrial, agricultural and natural world of Canada&#x2019;s West Coast.</p></p><p><p>Janet Nicol is a freelance writer with a special interest in art, history and social justice.

Carefully researched and engagingly written,&nbsp;<i>On the Curve</i>&nbsp;provides a compelling look into the quiet life of the artist behind the bold linocut prints. Nicol weaves together Sybil&#x2019;s journey from her childhood in England, her work in London as a &#x2018;professional female artist in a male-dominated world,&#x2019; to her life in Campbell River and her legacy as an internationally acclaimed artist.&#x201d;</p> (<i>Andrea Lister, editor of British Columbia History magazine and author of Commitment to Caring: Chilliwack Hospital Auxiliary&#x2019;s 100 Years</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Nicol has produced a compelling narrative of Andrews&#x2019; life, from her early years in Bury St Edmunds, to the artistic and musical communities she nurtured in the remote town of Campbell River on the coast of British Columbia.

Paul proclaimed that &#39;In Christ there is no more male and female&#39; Yet Christianity soon developed a patriarchal social structure, excluding women from public ministry, with the argument that women were created subordinate in nature and were more culpable for sin. Here, distinguished feminist theologian, Rosemary Ruether, traces the tension between patriarchal and egalitarian patterns in Christian theology historically. She then examines key theological themes--Christology, the self, the cross and future hope--in the light of her critique.</p><p></p><h2>Hearthside Cooking: Virginia Plantation Cuisine</h2><p>A favorite teaching tool of culinary demonstrators at historic sites, this cookbook boasts nearly 200 authentic colonial recipes.

He traces the lives of the men and women who turned to terrorism in America, the goals that motivated their behavior, and the crimes they committed.

The threat of a German invasion is real, and many German Nationals are interned in camps across the country. One such camp is on the ancient moor land of Prees Heath, near the small town of Whitchurch in Shropshire, where Tom Tyler is the sole detective inspector.<br><br>Young women from all walks of life have joined the Land Army, to help desperate farmers keep the country fed. When one of these young women is found murdered on a desolate country road, Tyler is almost glad for the challenge; he has been fretting for some time about the dullness of policing in a rural community. In addition, a former lover has reappeared and turned his emotions upside down; his soldier son seems utterly changed by his experience at Dunkirk; and his sixteen year old daughter is unhappy. As he pursues the murderer, Tyler finds himself drawn into an uneasy alliance with one of the Prees Heath internees, a psychiatrist, who claims to be an expert on the criminal mind.</p><p>Born in England, MAUREEN JENNINGS immigrated to Canada at the age of seventeen. After finishing high schoool, she earned a BA in psychology and philosophy and an MA in English literature. For eight years, she taught English at the Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (now Ryerson University) before becoming a psychotherapist. In the mid-1990s she started to write, and the first novel in her Detective Murdoch Mystery series was published in 1997. Six more novels in the series were published between 1998 and 2007, all of them to enthusiastic reviews. In 2003, Shaftesbury Films adapted three novels in the series into movies of the week, one of which earned the Bravo channel its highest MOV ratings to date. Four years later Shaftesbury, in association with CityTV, Rogers, UKTV, and Granada International, began production on the <i>Murdoch Mysteries</i> television series, starring Yannick Bisson as Murdoch. The popular series, soon to go into its fourth season, is now shown around the world, including on CityTV in Canada, the Alibi channel in the UK, and on most PBS stations in the United States. Maureen Jennings now writes full time from her home in Toronto, where she lives with her husband and their two dogs.In spite of the fact that she&#x2019;d got only a few hours sleep, Elsie Bates was in great spirits. Nothing like a nice bit of dock to make a girl smile. When he&#x2019;d told her this was his first time, she&#x2019;d expected him to be clumsy and done too fast, but he wasn&#x2019;t. She&#x2019;d helped him out here and there but mostly he&#x2019;d learned all by himself. Of course, like any man born to Eve, he&#x2019;d started to show a bit of possessiveness right off the bat, and she&#x2019;d had to make it clear that nobody owned her. Elsie grinned at the memory, then impulsively pushed down on the accelerator as far as she dared. The sun wasn&#x2019;t yet up and the road, which was hemmed in on either side by tall hedgerows, was pitch black. She had her headlights on, inadequate as they were with the strips of blackout tape across them, and she was driving as close to the middle of the road as she could, the lorry rattling and shaking on the rough surface.<br>&nbsp;<br>She started to sing to the tune of the &#x201c;Colonel Bogey March.&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Hitler has only got one ball,</i><br><i>Goering has two but they are small</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Wait &#x2019;til she told Rose about last night. Rosie kept saying she was saving herself, but as Elsie reminded her, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a war on, my pet. Butter&#x2019;s rationed but that don&#x2019;t mean we have to be.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Himmler has something sim&#x2019;lar,</i><br><i>But poor old Goebbels has no balls at all.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Elsie fingered the strap of her dungarees and smiled at the feel of the two bank notes she&#x2019;d sewn in there. Two quid would go a long way. When she&#x2019;d told Rose the story, her friend had been nervous.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oo, Elsie, be careful. People don&#x2019;t like to be blackmailed.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Who said anything about blackmail? I didn&#x2019;t say nothing. Nothing at all except to mention what I&#x2019;d seen, and out it popped: &#x2019;Ow much to keep that to yourself? Didn&#x2019;t come from me first.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d pinched Rose&#x2019;s thin cheek. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t be greedy. The occasional quid will do nicely. Stroke of luck, weren&#x2019; it? Me being there at that moment. Next leave we get, we&#x2019;re going to Birmingham for a few larks. Nobody&#x2019;ll wonder where the dosh is coming from. If asked, we&#x2019;ll say it&#x2019;s our wages saved up, which is a joke.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re as cunning as an old cat,&#x201d; said Rose. &#x201c;I just hope you&#x2019;ve got as many lives.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Elsie had taken the remark as a compliment. She&#x2019;d learned at too early an age to be that way. You had to if you were going to get out of that bleeding hellhole of a slum in any way intact. She made the sign of the cross over her chest. &#x201c;May God see fit to drop a bomb on all of them.&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Hitler has only got one ball,</i><br><i>The other is on the kitchen wall.</i><br><i>His mother, the dirty bugger,</i><br><i>Cut it off when he was small.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>The lorry went over a bump, gave a short cough, a splutter or two, then went silent and began to roll to a stop.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sod it, not again.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It was the third time this month the bloody thing had acted up. Elsie managed to steer over to the side, as close to the hedgerow as possible, before the momentum died. The road was barely wide enough for two vehicles to pass, and she&#x2019;d bring a lot of aggravation onto herself if she blocked the way completely. She tried turning the ignition key but the lorry was dead as a doornail. Sod, sod, and more sod. She was on a tight schedule. She had to pick up the girls at the hostel on time. Miss Stillwell, the warden, could be a bloody tartar. &#x201c;Late again, Miss Bates? Do pull up your socks, or I shall have to put you on report.&#x201d; Toffee- nosed old cow. If ever a woman acted like a dried- up spinster, it was her.<br>&nbsp;<br>Well, no sense in sitting here on her arse. Good thing she&#x2019;d brought her bike. She climbed down from the lorry. Somewhere along the way her back light had been knocked out, but the front lamp was working. Not that it was a lot of use, with the obligatory taped strips across it.<br>&nbsp;<br>The woods pressed in close here, narrowing the road even more. Elsie didn&#x2019;t like the country in the dark. She was used to paved streets and houses crammed together; a sense of the surrounding humanity. You could go for miles out here and not meet a soul. The rooks were putting up a God- awful clamour. Old Morgan had told them that sometimes birds can be as good as a watch dog, giving off warnings that there&#x2019;s danger near.<br>&nbsp;<br>She almost wished she&#x2019;d brought the gun with her. As she pedalled, she began to sing again to the tune of &#x201c;Land of Hope and Glory.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Land of soap and water</i><br><i>Hitler&#x2019;s having a bath</i><br><i>Churchill&#x2019;s looking through the keyhole</i><br><i>Having a jolly good laugh</i><br><i>Be . . . e . . . e . . . e . . . cause,</i><br><i>Hitler has only one small ball . . .</i><br>&nbsp;<br>She was glad for her overcoat. The pre-dawn air was chill and damp, just a bit of a hint that summer was ending. Fresh though, very fresh; one good thing you could say for the country. Since she&#x2019;d been here, she gained some weight and a good colour, which they had all admitted when she went home last time. After she&#x2019;d signed up with the Land Army, her dad, the miserable bugger, had said she wouldn&#x2019;t last a week, which only made her determined to show him. It hadn&#x2019;t been easy. When she&#x2019;d first arrived in Shropshire, she&#x2019;d never even seen a live cow before, let alone the bloody huge bull with the ring in its wet nose and its enormous goolies hanging down. The work in the fields was backbreaking, the hours appallingly long, and at first many of the farmers had been contemptuous of the girls, not willing to take into account their inexperience. Now the Land girls had earned their grudging respect. They worked as hard as men and learned fast. Elsie, herself, had been promoted to forewoman after only two months. When she&#x2019;d written to tell Ma and Dad and the others, nobody&#x2019;d bothered to answer. Sod them anyway.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Dawn was starting to seep through the trees and the exercise was getting her blood flowing. She kicked her feet off the pedals and did a little swoop from side to side just for fun. <i>Whoopee! </i>There was something to be said about this war. She&#x2019;d never have had this experience stuck in the filthy London back- to- back housing where she&#x2019;d grown up. She kicked out again. <i>Whoopee! </i>There was a dance in the village tonight and she&#x2019;d be there, new frock, new sweetheart.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hold on, was that a car? Maybe she could cadge a lift. She glanced over her shoulder. She heard the roar of the car as it emerged out of the darkness, the slitted headlights gleaming like cat&#x2019;s eyes. It was travelling fast. Too fast. Elsie swerved out of the way.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hey, slow down,&#x201d; she yelled.<br>&nbsp;<br>But in a moment the car was upon her.</p><h2>The Epic of Kings- Hero Tales of Ancient Persia (Wisehouse Classics - The Authoritative Edition)</h2><p><p><strong>The Shahnameh</strong>, also transliterated as <em>Shahnama</em> (&#x201c;The Book of Kings&#x201d;), is a long epic poem written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi between c. 977 and 1010 CE and is the national epic of Greater Iran. Consisting of some 50,000 &#x201c;distichs&#x201d; or couplets (2-line verses), the <em>Shahnameh</em> is the world's longest epic poem written by a single poet. It tells mainly the mythical and to some extent the historical past of the Persian Empire from the creation of the world until the Islamic conquest of Persia in the 7th century. Today Iran, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan and the greater region influenced by the Persian culture (such as Georgia, Armenia, Turkey and Dagestan) celebrate this national epic.</p><p>The work is of central importance in Persian culture, regarded as a literary masterpiece, and definitive of the ethno-national cultural identity of modern-day Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan. It is also important to the contemporary adherents of Zoroastrianism, in that it traces the historical links between the beginnings of the religion with the death of the last Sassanid ruler of Persia during the Muslim conquest and an end to the Zoroastrian influence in Iran.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Readies</h2><p>In 1930, Bob Brown predicted that the printed book was bound for obsolescence. The time has come, he insisted, to rid the reader of the cumbersome book. He invented a machine that would allow one to read books and any text extremely fast and in a hyper abbreviated form. He called these abbreviated texts, with em dashes replacing words: readies. He envisioned sending the condensed texts through wireless networks. The Readies, describes these eponymously named abbreviated texts and his plans for a reading machine, but since he printed only 150 copies, the volume is practically unknown outside of a small circle of scholars. With this new edition, Craig Saper hopes to introduce Bob Brown&#39;s Roving Eye Press books to a new generation of readers.</p><p><p><b>Robert Carlton Brown</b> (1886-1959) was an American author, journalist, publisher, and collector. Born in Chicago. Brown wrote pulp fiction, non-fiction, cookbooks, avant-garde publications, and experimented with a book of visual poetry; he also contributed pieces to various magazines and newspapers in New York City and established journals in Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City, and London. In 1929, he and his wife temporarily settled in France where they became involved in the expatriate literary community in Paris.

It sets the tone for this handy and humorous look at a beloved national pastime. William Dufris slips easily into Dalyï¿½s shoes and vernacular, hoists Dalyï¿½s bag of balls and tips, and seems to slide into the golf cart. His tone is that of a good old boy and great golfing buddy who advises listeners on banana slices, ripping grips, and drivers, as well as crusades for Bermuda shorts on the PGA tour and a strip-search ban on cell phones and cameras on the course.

R. K. McGregor Wright sees their efforts not as something radically new, but a contemporary reaffirmation of Arminianism. Concerned that evangelicals may soon find no place for sovereignty in their thinking, Wright sets out to show what&#39;s wrong--biblically, theologically and philosophically--with freewill theory in its ancient form. Along the way, he provides a short course in historical theology, making a fresh, powerful case for the Reformed emphasis on God&#39;s sovereign grace. Wright also meets challenges head-on with a discussion of the Arminian position and a chapter on the problem of evil. Finally, he subjects to close scrutiny the recent work of Clark Pinnock, a contemporary advocate of freewill theism.

A major novelist, Ballas has published fifteen works of fiction, several important studies on contemporary Arabic literature, and numerous translations from Arabic. Although he began his career in Arabic, Ballas switched to Hebrew in the mid 1960s. Ammiel Alcalay is a poet, translator, critic and scholar who teaches at Queens College and the CUNY Graduate Center, where he is the Deputy Chair of the PhD Program in English. His latest work is <em>Scrapmetal</em> (Factory School, 2006). He is also editor and translator of <em>Keys to the Garden</em>, and Semezdin Mehmedinovic's <em>Sarajevo Blues</em>, both published by City Lights. Oz Shelach, author and journalist, was born in West Jerusalem in 1968.</p>A septuagenarian Israeli novelist who emigrated from Baghdad in 1951, Ballas fictionalizes the life of Ahmad Soussa, an Iraqi Jew who converted to Islam in the 1930s. Soussa ended up writing works used in anti-Jewish propaganda by Saddam Hussein's regime, and Ballas begins during the Iran-Iraq War of the mid-1980s, with his character, Ahmad Haroun Saussan, writing a memoir (this book) in which he tries to explain why he wrote The Jews in History, an enormous work taken up by the regime. What unfolds is Saussan's life story, the primal scene being his marriage to a non-Jewish American woman, Jane, when he's a visiting engineering grad student in the U.S. in the 1930s. The marriage results in Saussan's elder brother and acting family patriarch, Daniel, disowning Saussan and having him excommunicated from his hometown Jewish enclave at al-Hila. That trauma sets off a chain of events that ruins Saussan's marriage and makes for a too-pat justification for all of his subsequent actions. Ballas also assumes a familiarity with Iraqi history that most American readers won't have, but his writing in Saussan's unreliable voice is immediate, vivid and richly elusive. As a case study in the rationalization of personal and political contradiction, the novel is entirely clear. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But the trigger-happy chief has a more modest goal: to wring a confession out of Mike Chalmers, an ex-con Squires has an old grudge against.

Again, the joyously precise period detail is the main attraction in this shrewd, affectionate slice of Americana (though sharp-eyed readers may wonder if Ma Bell had area codes as early as 1957).

She was the daughter of a high-ranking Russian diplomat, and the mother of three young sons, destined to join the social and intellectual elite of imperial Russia. The Revolution of 1917 changed the course of these lives. By December 1918 her husband was dead, her children separated from her by the closing of the frontiers, and her own life was in danger. This is her account of how she faced these traumatic events, revealing the courage and determination she had shown in earlier times that helped her endure hunger, imprisonment, and loneliness. Her reunion with her sons in 1921 makes the months of danger and deprivation worthwhile. Illustrated with original family photographs this account will interest the serious academic and general reader alike.</p><p>Edith Sollohub taught herself to type in order to support herself and her sons in their one-room apartment in Paris. She typed some of her account of her life in Russia in snatched moments, and added to these in later life. The manuscript of The Russian Countess was left to her youngest son and daughter-in-law after her death in 1965, who lovingly deciphered the handwritten notes, edited the text and unearthed photographs to ensure that her wish - that her memoirs might one day be published - be fulfilled.`A classic of the last years of the tsars that&#39;s essential reading on the regime of tsars and nobles in old Russia.

With echoes of Bunin, Sollohub captures the strange mixture of beauty and terror that was Russia in the first decades of the last century. An iridescent jewel of a book. (Douglas Smith, author of Rasputin and Former People: The Last Days of the Russian Aristocracy ) An epic and evocative tale of courage and endurance.

J. Box knows the wilderness and he knows how to create a wonderfully authentic, vividly alive sense of place. Most of all, he knows how to create a memorable new hero: a man who is full of failings, but strong and honorable. This is mystery writing at its best-and the beginning of a brilliant new career.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, July 2001:</b> Mystery debuts are both exciting and problematic. Exciting, because one may always be about to discover the next Hammett or Chandler (or so the copywriters and publicists would have us believe), and problematic because originality in such a well-grooved genre is becoming more and more at a premium.<p> In advance reviews, <i>Open Season</i> has been pronounced "something special," (<i>Booklist</i>), and it lives up to the billing. It is not C.J. Box's skill at plotting (the story of greedy business interests and local corruption is fine, but familiar), but rather the character of hero Joe Pickett, a Wyoming game warden, that makes this a series kickoff to remember. Like all the best mystery protagonists, Pickett is stubbornly ready to risk everything when his own personal sense of morality is at stake. But Joe is also a guy who sometimes gets things wrong, and this characteristic of messing up adds a dimension of humanity to the book.</p><p> C.J. Box makes the town of Twelve Sleep, Wyoming (where Joe and his pregnant wife and his daughters have come to live in a tiny house that could be a lot nicer if Joe only had a job that paid better), come alive to the extent that one can almost smell the crisp mountain air and pine needles. The locals display an impressive array of grudge holding and "don't mess with us" attitudes, but Joe is unwilling to forget he's sworn to uphold and enforce a full battery of laws that many of these neighbors have no intention of obeying.</p><p> When a well-known poacher, with whom he has humiliatingly tangled, suddenly turns up dead in his own backyard, Joe finds himself at the top of a downward path that, first, will lead to more bodies and then will put his entire family into peril. <i>Open Season</i> doesn't pull its punches, and Box does allow bad things to happen to good people.

To be successful in the material world or the spiritual world we must become more aware and more conscious, which requires research in the form of observation and study. The first benefit of researching the truth is it frees us from ignorance, fear and illusion that are at the root of our problems both in the material world and in the spiritual world. Simultaneously the research of truth brings us knowledge and wisdom. These are two different things. Knowledge is not wisdom but knowledge leads to wisdom. The System for the Research of Truth presented in the&nbsp;<em>Swimming with the Whale</em>&nbsp;Book will give you something far greater than regular knowledge which can be forgotten, it will give you&nbsp;<strong>experienced knowledge,&nbsp;</strong>which is something that you own, something that is a part of you and thus cannot be forgotten or lost.</p> <p>Of course the most important knowledge a Researcher of Truth can come to is who and what they are. Again this requires researching the truth in order to distinguish the difference between our constantly changing outer self (our personality) from our changeless Inner Self (the Soul). And this is the aim of the System for the Research of Truth as established by Dr. Stylianos Atteshlis who is more popularly known as Daskalos the Mystic of Strovolos. &nbsp;The. <em>Swimming with the Whale</em> book first introduces Daskalos as a young seven year old master and then reveals the 2000 year old lineage of the Researchers of Truth in this&nbsp;introductory workbook,&nbsp;<em>Swimming with the Whale.&nbsp;</em>This workbook guides your initial approach to these safe, effective and self-evident teachings and practices. &nbsp;</p> <p>Daniel began his training with Daskalos in 1989 on Cyprus and continues this work in North &amp; South America</p></p><p>You have had a tremendous impact on my life as I have learned so much reading your beautiful Swimming with the Whale book and listening to your wonderful Virtual Circle Lessons on the Radio The Swimming with the Whale book and the teachings of Daskalos take the reader to higher dimensions of enlightenment and faith. Excellent reading - Blessed to have found this book. Thank you for the Swimming with the Whale book it has been an answer to my prayers for truth and understanding. Your work is doing a great good for a great many people. God Bless. I'm currently finishing reading your book "Swimming with the Whale" eBook, and I'm amazed with Daskalos teachings and legacy. They are simple, practical, they make sense, and they produce results. And your book offers an excellent introduction for the beginner. I just ordered a copy of Swimming with the Whale after finding your book on the Web. From just a couple of minutes with it, I was stunned and delighted by its clarity. Bravo, congratulations, and thank you! Seldom in the History of mankind do the Teachings of a True Master become accurately/readily/and lovingly conveyed forward to those who are ready to receive and grow into their Truth. Daniel's Swimming with the Whale book is one of the very few to do that. Daskalos' primary teachings are available for those interested but Daniel, using those teachings and his own experiences and wisdom, adds that much need "spark" which ignites that flame. I have found the material to be really profound and every evening I work with the introspection exercise and have found it to be of enormous help to me. I really love the way that Swimming with the Whale is laid out, it makes quite complex subjects much easier to understand. Swimming with the Whale is a great in-depth journey into the mystical life and teachings of Daskalos. I have started to read your new book "Swimming with the Whale" I like it very much and just wanted to say thank you for your hard work in putting the Teachings in a way that I can understand and apply them! Thank you so much for the teachings &amp; practices in the swimming with the whale book. Now I have found safe meditations. I had been practicing certain meditation that resulted in hemorrhaging in my lungs. But more importantly for me, is that I now live in a new way, more happier, calmer, satisfying and confident and better about the future. I am also I starting to understand many things that I could not possibly understand before. This is a masterful book written by whom I conclude, after studying and practicing some of the material, must likewise be a masterful author.As you might expect there are anecdotes about his first-hand experiences with Daskalos, and I personally appreciate they are short and used sparingly. (It tells me that Joseph hasn't written this to satisfy his own egoism.) I highly recommend the book to anybody who considers themselves a "researcher of truth." In 25 well-written chapters, D. Joseph gives a complete survey of the basic teachings of Daskalos combined with practical exercises for the novice. Daskalos has "re-issued" the genuine esoteric Christianity of St. Paul and the best of the Early Church Fathers. Swimming with the Whale gives a "user friendly" version of very deep teaching about how the subtle world really works and how one can engage the work of true spiritual self-cultivation. I recommend this book to any Christian who realizes there is much more to the New Testament teaching than he has been able to find in "denominational Christianity". Swimming with the Whale is not marred by New Age silliness. It is a very difficult writing task - well done.</p><h2>Ways of the World: A Global History</h2><p>High School Ap course theme The Greatest strengths of this book lie in it&#39;s sucessful effort to focus on the AP course themes and its emphasis on historicizing major societal events and interactions.

For thousands of years people in despair and praise have cried to God through the words of these ancient poems. Fragments of them are still widely known and loved, but such is the gulf between their ancient culture and our contemporary world that much of the depth of their meaning is lost to us. </p><p><i>Life in the Psalms</i> aims to bridge that gulf, enabling the modern reader to find hope in these ancient texts by re-imagining their meanings for our times. The Psalms include texts that illuminate issues including climate change and environmental degradation; the illusions of consumerism and 'celebrity culture'; our response to migrants and asylum seekers; conditions of depression, anxiety, and grief, and the question of 'attention' in a digital age. Many texts take us deeply into the experience of meditation and contemplation; and teach us how to wonder, and find happiness. </p><p>Three introductory chapters are followed by reflections on thirty Psalms (one for each weekday of Lent), which aim to illuminate the text and help those in search of a more contemplative spirituality to discover, in the midst of the hard realities of a secular twenty-first century world, a deep consciousness of the healing mystery of God.</p></p><p>Patrick Woodhouse is a writer and Anglican priest.

But the story started long before then, and here Edward T. Sullivan delves into all the advances that led to the making of the most destructive weapons ever invented: the scientific developments of the Manhattan Project, the massive commitment by the Western world to win the great nuclear arms race, and the contributions to the war effort big or small by all those involved. From bus driver to scientist to spy to the president, Sullivan examines all the key personalities concerned, including Albert Einstein, J. Robert Oppenheimer, President Roosevelt, and many more. The dropping of the bomb, as well as the complicated aftermath is also discussed. In this comprehensive book, featuring several arresting black-and-white photographs of the day, Sullivan offers a broad and compelling look at the atomic bomb and its pronounced effects on our world today.</p><p>Edward T. Sullivan has worked as a public and school librarian for over ten years. The author of many articles and books for librarians and teachers, this is his first book for young people. He lives with his wife and three cats in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, a city that played a major role in the building of the first atomic bombs.The history of the Manhattan Project presents a daunting challenge to any author writing for a general audience&#x2014;especially when that audience is young readers. Sullivan responds admirably with an account that effectively distills the science behind the development of the atomic bomb into understandable terms and that turns the human story behind the project into compelling drama. Most histories of the Manhattan Project focus on Robert Oppenheimer and the other scientists who worked with him to create the bomb at Los Alamos, but Sullivan gives plenty of space to the activities at the two other project sites: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where enhanced uranium was manufactured, and Hanford, Washington, where bomb-ready plutonium was developed. Without slighting the familiar parts of the Manhattan Project story&#x2014;the scientific breakthroughs, the Trinity test, the flight of the Enola Gay, the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosions&#x2014;Sullivan takes readers into daily life at all three sites, showing the less-than-comfortable conditions under which thousands of men and women worked. Effectively illustrated with archival photographs, this volume will be useful both as personal reading and as background for reports.

A twisty page-turner." &#x2015;Michael Stanley, award-winning author of the Detective Kubu mysteries</strong></p><p>Mykonos holds tight to its past even as it transforms from an obscure, impoverished Aegean island into a tourist mecca and summertime playground for the world's rich, a process making the Mykonian people some of the wealthiest in Greece. Yes, the old guard is still a force to be reckoned with despite the new money. One of them, a legendary nightclub owner, has been found savagely bludgeoned in his home. All evidence points to obvious thugs. Yet the murder has put long hidden, politically explosive secrets in play and drawn a dangerous foreign investor to the island paradise. Andreas Kaldis, feared head of Greece's special crimes division, is certain there's a far more complex solution to the murder than robbery, and he vows to find it. His quest for answers cuts straight into the entrenched cultural contradictions that give Mykonos so much of its magic and soon has him battling ruthless opportunists preying on his country's weakened financial condition. Kaldis learns there is a high, unexpected price to pay for his curiosity as he becomes locked in a war with a powerful, clandestine international force willing to do whatever it takes to change and wrest control of Mykonos, no matter the collateral damage. Such is global crime. And the need for a wily hero to stand against it.</p></p><p><p>Jeffrey Siger was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, practiced law at a major Wall Street law firm, and later established his own New York City law firm where he continued as one of its name partners until giving it all up to write full-time among the people, life, and politics of his beloved Mykonos. <em>The Mykonos Mob</em> is the tenth novel in his internationally best-selling and award nominated Chief Inspector Andreas Kaldis series, following up on <em>An Aegean April</em>, <em>Santorini Caesars</em>, <em>Devil in Delphi</em>, <em>Sons of Sparta</em>, <em>Mykonos After Midnight</em>, <em>Target: Tinos</em>, <em>Prey on Patmos</em>, <em>Assassins of Athens</em>, and <em>Murder in Mykonos</em>.</p><p><em>The New York Times</em> described Jeffrey Siger's novels as "thoughtful police procedurals set in picturesque but not untroubled Greek locales," and named him as Greece's thriller writer of record. <em>The Greek Press</em> called his work "prophetic," Eurocrime described him as a "very gifted American author...on a par with other American authors such as Joseph Wambaugh or Ed McBain," and the City of San Francisco awarded him its Certificate of Honor citing that his "acclaimed books have not only explored modern Greek society and its ancient roots but have inspired political change in Greece."

Beneath that goal the book aims to ground believers in orthodox Christian theology and the actual contents of the Bible. Students are encouraged to thoughtfully draw conclusions from the Scriptures rather than to merely absorb the principles, inferences, and illustrations set before them by the author. For this reason the book does not include such material and instead focuses on digesting the Scriptures directly. <p> Through God s own words and under various systematic headings the book unfolds the nature of God. In this way the reader is set on a firm foundation and will readily perceive the centrality and high authority of biblical doctrine within the Christian life. It is the author s conviction that the study of doctrine is both an intellectual and devotional discipline. Therefore students are guided throughout the study to think through and apply the truths they learn, meditating on the demands of Scripture for their heart and mind. The book puts us squarely in the middle of the material, and demands we give searching thought to how we will live before such a God. </p><p> This workbook is especially suited for the following contexts: (1) doctrinal training for new converts; (2) college or adult Bible studies; (3) private study; (4) Christian or home school curriculum; (5) Sunday school material; (6) an aid to parents in teaching the Word of God to their children.</p></p><p>Paul Washer became a believer while attending the University of Texas studying to become an oil and gas lawyer. He completed his undergraduate studies and enrolled at Southwestern Theological Seminary where he received his Master of Divinity degree. He left the states shortly after graduation as a North American missionary to Peru. <p> Paul ministered as a missionary in Peru for 10 years, during which time he founded the HeartCry Missionary Society to support Peruvian Church planters. The work of HeartCry now supports over 80 indigenous missionaries in 15 different countries throughout Eastern Europe, South America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. </p><p> An itinerant preacher, Paul also frequently teaches at his home church, Grace Life Church of the Shoals. At present, Paul serves as the Director of HeartCry Missionary Society and resides in Muscle Shoals, Alabama with his wife Charo and two sons Ian and Evan, and one daughter Rowan.</p>In The One True God, Paul Washer has provided a sound, biblical, substantive theological study for those of us who have been longing for more. Anyone interested in bolstering their understanding of the Doctrine of God will find this study immensely valuable. Moreover, since The One True God is expositional in nature, it can also serve as a teaching tool to give young believers a solid foundation, or to aid in evangelizing unbelievers. --<b>--Voddie Bauchum, Author of Family Driven Faith</b><br><br>Paul David Washer's study guide on the doctrine of God, The One True God, is the best introductory work known to me. It sets out great truths in clear and balanced form. Human authorities are not quoted but it is evident that the author is familiar with the literature of historic Christianity and accordingly he misses the pitfalls into which others might fall. Young Christians could scarcely spend their time better than working carefully through these pages. --<b>--Iain H Murray, Banner of Truth</b><br><br>The One True God will lead you through a profitable exercise in biblical and systematic theology.

Visit her at www.barbaradelinsky.com.Leah Gates made a final fold in the blue foil paper, then studied her creation in dismay. "This does not look like a roadrunner," she whispered to the woman at the table beside her.<br><br>Victoria Lesser, who'd been diligently folding a pelican, shifted her attention to her friend's work. "Sure, it does," she whispered back. "It's a roadrunner."<br><br>"And I'm a groundhog." Leah raised large, round glasses from the bridge of her nose in the hope that a myopic view would improve the image. It didn't. She dropped the frames back into place.<br><br>"It's a roadrunner," Victoria repeated.<br><br>"You're squinting."<br><br>"It looks like a roadrunner."<br><br>"It looks like a conglomeration of pointed paper prongs."<br><br>Lifting the fragile item, Victoria turned it from side to side. She had to agree with Leah's assessment, though she was far too tactful to say so. "Did you get the stretched bird base right?"<br><br>"I thought so."<br><br>"And the book fold and the mountain fold?"<br><br>"As far as I know."<br><br>"Then there must be some problem with the rabbit-ear fold."<br><br>"I think the problem's with me."<br><br>"Nuh-uh."<br><br>"Then with you," Leah scolded in the same hushed whisper. "It was your idea to take an origami course. How do I let myself get talked into these things?"<br><br>"Very easily. You love them as much as I do. Besides, you're a puzzle solver, and what's origami but a puzzle in paper? You've done fine up to now. So today's an off day."<br><br>"That's an understatement," Leah muttered.<br><br>"Ladies?" came a call from the front of the room. Both Leah and Victoria looked up to find the instructor's reproving stare homing in on them over the heads of the other students. "I believe we're ready to start on the frog base. Are there any final questions on the stretched bird base?"<br><br>Leah quickly shook her head, then bit her lip against a moan of despair. The frog base?<br><br>Victoria simply sat with a gentle smile on her face. By the time the class had ended, though, the smile had faded. Taking Leah by the arm, she ushered her toward the door. "Come on," she said softly. "Let's get some coffee."<br><br>When they were seated in a small coffee shop on Third Avenue, Victoria wasted no time in speaking her mind. "Something's bothering you. Out with it."<br><br>Leah set her glasses on the table. They'd fogged up the instant she'd come in from the cold, and long-time experience told her they'd be useless for several minutes. The oversize fuchsia sweater Victoria wore was more than bright enough to be seen by the weakest of eyes, however, and above the sweater was the gentlest of expressions. It was toward these that Leah sent a sheepish look. "My frog base stunk, too, huh?"<br><br>"Your mind wasn't on it. Your attention's been elsewhere all night. Where, if I may be so bold as to ask?"<br><br>Leah had to laugh at that. In the year she'd known Victoria Lesser, the woman had on occasion been far bolder. But not once had Leah minded. What might have been considered intrusive in others was caring in Victoria. She was compassionate, down-to-earth and insightful, and had such a remarkably positive view of the world that time spent with her was always uplifting.<br><br>"Guess," Leah invited with a wry half grin.<br><br>"Well, I know your mind's not on your marriage, because that's been over and done for two years now. And I know it's not on a man, because despite my own considerable&#x2014;" she drawled the word pointedly "&#x2014;efforts to fix you up, you refuse to date. And I doubt it's on your work, because crosswords are in as much of a demand as ever, and because just last week you told me that your contract's been renewed. Which leaves your apartment." Victoria knew how much Leah adored the loft she'd lived in since her divorce. "Is your landlord raising the rent?"<br><br>"Worse."<br><br>"Oh-oh. He's talking condo conversion."<br><br>"He's <em>decided</em> condo conversion."<br><br>"Oh, sweetheart. Mucho?"<br><br>"Mucho mucho."<br><br>"When's it happening?"<br><br>"Too soon." Idly Leah strummed the rim of her glasses, then, as though recalling their purpose, slipped them back onto her nose. "I can look for another place, but I doubt I'll find one half as nice. Waterfront buildings are hot, and most of them have already gone condo. Even if there were a vacancy in one of the few remaining rentals, I doubt I could afford it."<br><br>"Thank you, New York."<br><br>"Mmm." Seeking to warm her chilled fingers, Leah wrapped her hands around her coffee cup. "Prices have gone sky-high in the two years since I rented the loft. The only reason I got it at a reasonable rate in the first place was that I was willing to fix it up myself. It was a mess when I first saw it, but the view was...ineffable."<br><br>"Ineffable?"<br><br>"Indescribable. It isn't fair, Victoria. For weeks I scraped walls and ceilings, sanded, painted, and now someone else will reap the fruits of my labor." She gave a frustrated growl. "I had a feeling this was coming, but that doesn't make it any easier to take."<br><br>Victoria's heart went out to this woman who'd become such a special friend. They'd met the year before in the public library and had hit it off from the start. Victoria had enjoyed Leah's subtle wit and soft-spoken manner. Though at the age of thirty-three Leah was twenty years younger, they shared an interest in things new and different. They'd gone to the theater together, tried out newly opened restaurants together, taken classes not only in origami but in papier-mache, conversational Russian and ballet.<br><br></p><h2>The European Challenge (American Indians)</h2><p>Looks at the impact of encounters with white settlers on the Indians in each region of North America</p><p></p><h2>Max&#39;s Journal: The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl</h2><p>An artifact from the world of the movie, written and drawn by the main character.

Pan-continental trade between these hunters and horticulturists helped make the lifeways of Plains Indians among the richest and most colorful of Native Americans.<br><br>This volume is the first attempt to synthesize current knowledge on the cultural history of the Great Plains since Wedel's Prehistoric Man on the Great Plains became the standard reference on the subject almost forty years ago. Fourteen authors have undertaken the task of examining archaeological phenomena through time and by region to present a systematic overview of the region's human history. Focusing on habitat and cultural diversity and on the changing archaeological record, they reconstruct how people responded to the varying environment, climate, and biota of the grasslands to acquire the resources they needed to survive.<br><br>The contributors have analyzed archaeological artifacts and other evidence to present a systematic overview of human history in each of the five key Plains regions: Southern, Central, Middle Missouri, Northeastern, and Northwestern. They review the Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Woodland, and Plains Village peoples and tell how their cultural traditions have continued from ancient to modern times. Each essay covers technology, diet, settlement, and adaptive patterns to give readers an understanding of the differences and similarities among groups. The story of Plains peoples is brought into historical focus by showing the impacts of Euro-American contact, notably acquisition of the horse and exposure to new diseases.<br><br>Featuring 85 maps and illustrations, <i>Archaeology on the Great Plains</i> is an exceptional introduction to the field for students and an indispensable reference for specialists.

In these seventeen short stories--eleven of which are appearing in English for the first time--al-Shaykh expands her horizons beyond the boundaries of Lebanon, taking us throughout the Middle East, to Africa, and finally to London. Stylistically diverse, her stories are often about the shifting and ambiguous power relationships between different cultures--as well as between men and women. Often compared to both Margaret Atwood and Margaret Drabble, Hanan al-Shaykh is "a gifted and courageous writer" (<i>Middle Eastern International</i>).</p><p>In the seventeen short stories that comprise I Sweep the Sun Off Rooftops, al-Shaykh limns in evocative prose the shifting and ambiguous power relationships that shape the landscape of the modern Arab world. Al-Shaykh&#39;s characters find themselves at the intersection of tradition and encroaching modernity, of East and West, of the innocence of childhood and the realities of adult life, of the everyday and the fantastical. In these stories, a woman feigns insanity to escape from an empty marriage, only to have her plans backfire; a young Danish missionary finds herself slowly and inexorably drawn into the world of the Yemeni village where she has been sent to work; a woman&#39;s lighthearted attempt to contact the world of the dead turns serious when she encounters the spirit of her late husband.<b>Hanan al-Shaykh</b>,&nbsp;an award-winning journalist, novelist, and playwright, is the author of the short story collection&nbsp;<i>I Sweep the Sun off Rooftops</i>; the novels <i>One Thousand and One Nights, The Story of Zahra, Women of Sand and Myrrh, Beirut Blues</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Only in London</i>; and a memoir about her mother,&nbsp;<i>The Locust and the Bird.</i>&nbsp;She was raised in Beirut, educated in Cairo, and lives in London.</p><h2>Illustrated Treasury of the American Locomotive Company</h2><p>A history of the American Locomotive Company contains a chronology of notable Alco achievements and photographs of representative locomotives</p><p></p><h2>Space frontier</h2><p>1971 copyright.

Her portrait of the chameleonlike artist is much more than an account of Bowles's life, however. It is also a meditation on biography that questions the biographer's role, the subject's credibility, and the very nature of "truth" in the telling of a life.<br><br>Millicent Dillon first met Paul Bowles in Tangier in 1977, when she was writing a biography of his wife, the author Jane Bowles, who died in 1973. Dillon returned to Morocco in 1992 to work with Bowles on a book about his own life. In Bowles's book-lined apartment often crowded with visitors, Dillon observes the magnetism the aging artist exerts on anyone who comes into his circle. Bowles talks of his difficult childhood and of his grief over Jane's long illness, of exile, dreams, and madness. He is charming and evasive with Dillon, generous and devious. As the book unfolds, Dillon's own reflections and concerns surface alongside details of Bowles's daily life, his physical condition, his interactions with others. Her portrait of the artist is seen simultaneously with her construction of that portrait, and in a kind of literary legerdemain we are able to observe Dillon on the biographical canvas along with Bowles and his deceased wife.<br><br>Author of the international bestseller <i>The Sheltering Sky</i> and numerous other works, as well as an acclaimed composer, Paul Bowles has had an immensely rich creative life. Millicent Dillon seems to have been destined to write this unconventional biography of the artist, and the result is wonderful, disturbing, and strangely compelling, like Paul Bowles himself.</p><p>At the center of Millicent Dillon's provocatively titled <i>You Are Not I</i> burns a mystery. The ever elusive Paul Bowles indirectly captured Dillon's attention. When in Tangier, Morocco, at work on her biography of Jane Bowles (<i>A Little Original Sin</i>, 1981), she was told repeatedly by friends of the Bowles that she bore an uncanny physical resemblance to Jane. For Dillon, this burgeoned into a compulsion, which she found "...unsettling, as if I am overstepping a line, violating that most rudimentary law of biography--not to confuse oneself with one's subject." Alas, in spite of the strong declaration implicit in the biography's title, one is made uncomfortably aware of the author's wavering boundaries. "To be a biographer," Dillon confesses, "meant that I was in the grip of an obsession." <p> Rejecting chronology as the chief organizing element of her biography, Dillon interweaves the "facts"--mundane and extraordinary--of Bowles's life with both of her Moroccan journeys (the Jane project of 1977; the Paul project of '91), constructing his portrait through their conversations and her subsequent reflections. Such a prismatic approach indeed celebrates Bowles's obliquity as a subject. But then, Millicent Dillon is herself "...in search of a different kind of knowing--one that is consonant with secrecy, one that ... is more akin to the knowing one has of a character in a work of fiction." That unique teasing out of the truth makes <i>You Are Not I</i> an exploration of the form, biography, itself.</p><p> Bowles was born on Long Island. As a child he leaned toward musical composition and short story writing. In young adulthood, he would study with Aaron Copland, and later, mingle in Paris with the likes of Gertrude Stein, who advised him to journey to Morocco with Copland to work on music. He married Jane (in 1938); she had had affairs with women only; he'd had bisexual attachments. Paul continued his involvement with avant-garde music; Jane struggled with her novel, <i>Two Serious Ladies</i>. As he helped her, his old love of fiction was triggered, and in 1949, he published <i>The Sheltering Sky</i>, which became an international bestseller. After Jane Bowles's death, Paul's work life receded. It would be Bertolucci's film of <i>The Sheltering Sky</i> (1987) that delivered Bowles back into the public eye. </p><p> By risking subjectivity, placing herself firmly in the "process" of biography, Dillon becomes unwilling to make absolute statements about her subject. An annoying cacophony ensues--of impressions, of contradictory and elliptical conversations, the contents of which refuse to be assigned significance. But it's not entirely annoying, for the utter foreignness of Bowles's world flashes through. Along with the accounts of the continuous smoking of cannabis and cigarettes, we're given vivid glimpses of a uniquely bohemian life, carved out of exile.<i>You Are Not I</i> has everything--the romance of the far away; on- the-scene reporting of a place at once sensuous and creepy. It's a guide for those intrigued both with the form of biography and with the life of the writer who would come to fear going out in public; who needed to smoke kif (cannabis) to relieve his almost continuous anxiety; who "abhorred directness." And it is nothing less than a quest to solve some fundamental mystery about the self, as if Millicent Dillon got entangled in a Paul Bowles story and is compelled by the force of the narrative events to ride them through to there exhilarating, perhaps fatal, finish.</p>"Less a biography than a meditation on the curious nature of biography and on the even more curious nature of Paul Bowles. Brilliantly done, and intensely interesting."&#x2014;Alice Adams<br><br>"[I love the Paul Bowles biography.] A seriously innovative biography about a fascinating literary figure, an exotic locale, the haunting ghost of Jane Bowles, and an endearing and important biographer. Any of these ingredients would be enough to recommend it; altogether, a brilliant book."&#x2014;Diane Johnson<br><br>"I am impressed by the honesty, lucidity, and maturity in every sentence. This stunning pas de deux by two wary, relentlessly intelligent people is a delicious reading experience."&#x2014;Phillip Lopate, author of <i>Portrait of my Body and Art of the Personal Essay</i><br><br>"Millicent Dillon brilliantly manages to turn her difficulties with the notorious elusiveness of Paul Bowles, and of Tangiers, into the most revealing account ever given of his personality and his achievements. It's a fascinating, exhilirating book."&#x2014;Richard Poirier</p><h2>Porcupine&#39;s Pajama Party (I Can Read!)</h2><p>Porcupine bakes cookies, watches a monster movie, and gets scared in the dark when his two best friends sleep over.</p><p><p>Doug Cushman is the creator of many favorite mystery stories for young readers featuring such memorable heroes as the intrepid Aunt Eater, the grasshopper gumshoe Inspector Hopper, and the ace reporter Dirk Bones. He has also illustrated many books written by other authors, including Jack Prelutsky's <em>What a Day It Was at School!</em> He lives in Paris, France. </p>The prospect of a sleepover can be both exciting and scary for the younger elementary school child. This exuberant I Can Read captures both reactions in four low-key and satisfyingly funny stories. Porcupine invites his two best friends to spend the night. Owl wants to try out a new cookie recipe, but the three buddies eat the batter up before they get into the oven. Otter wants to watch "Monster Bat" on TV, and they all end up scared silly. In the last story, they squabble over places in the double bed and each confronts his own personal "monster." Cushman's humorous line drawings, washed in color, are well matched to the text. Newcomers to the I Can Read line as well as fans of Arnold Lobel's Frog and Toad will warm to these three amigos.

No legs. No defense.<br><br>Born without limbs for reasons never determined, I was blessed in so many other ways. My greatest blessing was a loving and supportive family. They sheltered and encouraged me for the first years of my life. But once I left the protective shelter<br>of family for the hallways and playgrounds of elementary school, I felt like I had a target on my chest that said, &#x201c;Bullies, aim here.&#x201d;<br><br>I felt alone in my fear of bullies, but I wasn&#x2019;t alone. And neither are you.<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve been bullied, the first thing you need to understand is that their attacks, taunts, and mean acts aren&#x2019;t really about you, any flaws you might have, or anything you might have done. Bullies have their own issues. They pick on you to make themselves feel better, to vent their anger, to feel more powerful, or even because they can&#x2019;t think of anything else to do.<br><br>I know it&#x2019;s lame, but it&#x2019;s true.<br><br>When I was a teenager, I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out why bullies picked on me. There was one guy in particular who really got inside my head. He bullied everybody, but for some reason I took it personally. I obsessed over his motives.<br>Finally I realized that his bullying wasn&#x2019;t about my problems. It was about his.<br><br>You may have a bully who has had the same impact on you, getting inside your head, knotting your stomach with stress, and tormenting your dreams because you can&#x2019;t figure out why you are the target. I&#x2019;m here to ease your mind and lighten that burden.<br>Your bully&#x2019;s motives don&#x2019;t matter. You do.<br><br>Your safety and your happiness are important to me and everyone else who loves and cares about you; so instead of focusing on why a bully is picking on you, let&#x2019;s focus on helping you feel secure and happy again.<br><br>Does that sound like a plan? I think so!<br><br>But before we move on, I want you to know that there is no single infallible strategy for dealing one-on-one with bullies. And I certainly don&#x2019;t recommend you resort to violence if you can help it! Don&#x2019;t ever let a bully lure you into a fight. If a bully attacks you, defend yourself but get away as fast as you can. If you have any reason to think a bully is going to harm you physically, you need to talk to an adult who can help you before that happens.<br><br>The Bullying Epidemic<br><br>It&#x2019;s important to understand from the beginning that many people share your pain in dealing with this problem. Being bullied, sadly, is as common as catching a cold or stubbing your toe. I travel all over the world talking to young people about this issue. No matter where I go, bullying is a major topic of concern. Teens in every school in every town and every country tell me they have mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual pain because of being bullied.<br><br>A teen in China told me that he&#x2019;d tried to commit suicide eight times because of being bullied at school. A cute little Korean girl in Boise, Idaho, came up to me crying after I gave a speech on bullying. She said, &#x201c;I get teased every day about being Korean because I&#x2019;m the only Asian in the whole school.&#x201d; I hear similar stories from bullying victims in Chile, Brazil, Australia, Russia, Serbia, and around the world. Bullying is everywhere, and it takes many forms. Most of us are familiar with childhood bullies who threaten to beat us up, make fun of us, or turn friends against us. Adults may experience bullying in the form of sexual harassment or as discrimination based on race, religion, sexual identity, or disabilities. Bullies can be your boss, coworkers, teachers, coaches, boyfriends, or girlfriends&#x2014;anyone who abuses his power or position.<br><br>It&#x2019;s sad to say, but parents can be bullies too. Suicides are a major problem among young people in Asia, and part of the problem is that many teens are under incredible pressure to earn top grades so they can make it into the best schools and get the best jobs for the most pay. Parents naturally want their children to do well, but when a mother and father give love and support only if their child is successful in their eyes, it is a form of bullying. There was one case in which the parents burned their child with cigarettes because her grades were not up to their standards. That&#x2019;s an extreme case to be sure, but I&#x2019;ve encountered similar stories around the world.<br><br>The most common bullying experience is being taunted or ridiculed for being &#x201c;different&#x201d; in some way. I&#x2019;m the poster child for this. For most of my life, I&#x2019;ve been a bully magnet. I&#x2019;ve heard every imaginable nasty comment about my lack of limbs. Cruel jokes. Even physical threats.<br><br>It didn&#x2019;t help that my family moved a couple of times when I was in school. We went from one side of Australia to the other, then we moved to the United States and back again. At each new school, I wasn&#x2019;t just the only kid with no arms and no legs; I was usually the only kid in a wheelchair. When we moved to the United States, I hit the bully-target trifecta: I was the only kid in my school with no arms and no legs, the only kid in a wheelchair, and the only kid with an Australian accent! Different? Me, mate?<br><br>Sure, I stood out from the crowd, and the fact that I was often the new kid without friends made me an even easier target. But I realized early on that bullies would find a reason to pick on anyone. They called the smart kids &#x201c;nerds,&#x201d; the tall kids &#x201c;bird legs,&#x201d; and the short kids &#x201c;runts.&#x201d; If perfect people existed, bullies probably would mock them for being &#x201c;too perfect.&#x201d;<br><br>Still, if you are being bullied, it hurts. It&#x2019;s a terrible experience that often seems like it will never end. As someone who endured it throughout my teenage years and still runs into it from time to time, I want to give you hope and peace. You can rise above and beyond it.</p><h2>BLIND OWL.</h2><p>The story is narrated by a young man, a painter of miniatures, whose name is never given.

Kasson is a professor of history and American studies at the University of North Carolina&#x2013;Chapel Hill and the author of Amusing the Million, among many other seminal works of cultural history. He lives in Chapel Hill.The Little Girl Who Fought the Great Depression is an illuminating and highly entertaining look at the life and career of the greatest young movie star of her era. John Kasson perceptively reveals how Shirley Temple brought hope and joy to a diverse array of people throughout the world while simultaneously transforming the nature of celebrity, consumption, and childhood culture in 1930s America. --Steven J. Ross, author of Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics<br><br>John Kasson delights the reader with his lively account of feel-good films starring the adorable curly-headed moppet who, with radiant smile and winsome guile, lit up the dark nights of the 1930s. A brilliant analyst, Kasson lays bare coruscatingly, too, how exploited child actors serve as canaries in the mine shaft of modern consumer culture. --William E. Leuchtenburg, author of In the Shadow of FDR: From Harry Truman to Barack Obama<br><br>Carefully argued and gracefully written. Not since the pioneering essays of Warren Susman has any historian so brilliantly illuminated the emotional life of Americans in the 1930s. The Great Depression not to mention Shirley Temple and Franklin Roosevelt will never look the same. --Jackson Lears, author of Rebirth of a Nation: The Making of Modern America, 1877-1920<br><br>John F. Kasson skillfully uses Shirley Temple as a prism to cast light on a vast range of subjects: The rise of FDR, optimism as Depression-era propaganda, the double existence of African-American stars, innocence as a consumer commodity, the fickleness of star adoration and the dangers of the mob, the meaning of childhood in a changing culture, and Hollywood's exploitation of its human profit centers, no matter how small. Connecting them all is Temple herself, serene, self-composed, and indestructible the one movie star who wasn't putting on an act. --Ty Burr, author of Gods Like Us: On Movie Stardom and Modern Fame<br><br>Sparkling, beautifully written, nearly impossible to put down. John Kasson moves behind the seemingly effortless smile of Shirley Temple to uncover the child labor it required, and explores the complex emotional work performed by that smile for Americans struggling to survive the Great Depression.

Collected too is all his art, plus scores of other illustrations featuring Hill-inspired art by IWWs from Ralph Chaplin to Carlos Cortez, as well as other labor artists. &#34;It has been a long time since so much new material on Joe Hill and the Wobblies has been collected in one volume.

This is no ordinary biography. It is a journey into the Wobbly culture that made Joe Hill and the capitalist culture that killed him.

He will live in the minds of young rebels as long as his songs are sung, his ideas are circulated, and his political descendants keep fighting for a better day.&#34; [Robin D G Kelley]</p><p>Franklin Rosemont was born on October 2, 1943, in Chicago, Illinois.

Most members of the Collective have worked together for at least 15 years, and&nbsp;some have worked for the restaurant since&nbsp;it was founded in 1973. The Moosewood Collective is the recipient of three James Beard Awards and numerous nominations. <i>Moosewood Restaurant Cooking for Health</i> is its twelfth book.<b></b><p><b> Introduction </b> </p><p> The Moosewood Collective has written a dozen cookbooks filled with recipes for flavorful, interesting vegetarian food from soups to desserts. We've covered quick and easy meals and cooking for celebrations. One of our books is about the world of ethnic cuisines; another teaches you how to cook from your own kitchen garden. Many of our early recipes are loaded with cheese, and one of our most popular cookbooks is all about low-fat fare. Sometimes we think we've said everything we have to say, but then we find new ingredients, new cuisines, and new information, and ultimately we find we have new perspectives. Today we want freshness and integrity of ingredients. Our food must be attractive and delicious, but we also want it to contribute to good health. Really, we want it all. </p><p> We read and hear a lot about nutrition. We are bombarded with information on food, and the media definition of healthful food changes from week to week. Bits of nutritional information can be blown out of proportion, taken out of context, or viewed in isolation without considering the complexity of interactions in the body. Sometimes studies are poorly interpreted in the media. Too much of what we learn comes from advertising. Sometimes it seems that we receive more nutritional advice (and some of it contradictory) than we can process. </p><p> However, science continues to advance. New and better findings supplant the old, and nutritional recommendations change. So we are careful to heed only the advice of reputable sources, and we deliberate and then proceed with caution before changing our eating habits or making recommendations of our own. </p><p> One thing we know is that the surest source of nutritious and delicious food is your own kitchen. And we've noticed that all the experts we trust agree on a few things: eat more plant foods -- fruits, vegetables, beans, whole grains, nuts and seeds; avoid processed foods, refined sugars and carbohydrates, additives and preservatives; cut back on fats, especially trans fats and saturated fats. Many essential vitamins, minerals, and other phytonutrients are found abundantly -- sometimes exclusively -- in the plant world, and most people will be healthier longer if they pack their diets with plant foods. Well, that's what we're good at. Moosewood has been focused on making delicious vegetarian whole foods for years. </p><p> Judging by our customers' questions and requests, and by scanning the magazine covers while waiting in the supermarket checkout line, we think our health concerns are probably similar to yours: achieving wellness, enhancing fitness, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing chronic illness with a conscious diet. </p><p> Most people are aware of the role food plays in good health -- the five-a-day message has been heard -- yet it is believed that fewer than a third of Americans come close to this goal. Newer guidelines from the National Cancer Institute call for seven servings of fruit and vegetables a day for women and nine a day for men. Oldways recommends twelve servings of antioxidant-rich foods a day. It seems that although we acknowledge the nourishing and healing powers of plant foods, most of us still need help getting enough vegetables and fruits into our diets to enjoy these positive effects. </p><p> There are a number of things we've kept in mind while creating recipes for this book. First of all, we want to cook with real, whole, natural foods, and we want to avoid processed and refined ingredients. So we started with the basics: whole grains rather than refined grains; olive oil instead of the "bad" fats; sweetness from the fruits and vegetables themselves; and lots and lots of dark green, red, orange, yellow, purple, and blue. We've included refined carbohydrates and sugars in scant amounts only or not at all, and we've completely avoided the "white foods": white bread, white pasta, white rice, and white potatoes. Not all fruits and vegetables are created equal, it turns out; some are phytonutrient superstars. So we looked for new ways to use blueberries, sweet potatoes, kale, seaweed, cherries, nuts, and pomegranates. </p><p> Then we looked at cooking techniques. We played with all of the methods the kitchen has to offer -- steaming, sautï¿½ing, roasting, baking, braising, grilling, boiling, simmering, and stewing -- to come up with healthier ways to prepare some of our old favorites. Healthier not only in terms of our bodies, but also better for the environment. For example, we've baked tofu in the oven for years. That's fine when it's cold out and the heat from the oven helps warm the house or when the oven is on anyway for some other dish. But what about when it's hot out and the house needs to be cooled down, not heated up? In this book, we have several recipes for stove-top tofu, like Pomegranate-glazed Tofu, that cook more quickly over direct heat, using less energy. </p><p> We also explored some of the intriguing ways to prepare raw "living" food dishes, such as Winter Squash "Rice Mexicali"; and we came up with more healthful but still satisfying ways to attain certain qualities. For example, we thickened creamy Watercress and Cauliflower Soup with cauliflower rather than potatoes or a flour-and-fat roux, and we made a delicious Sweet Potato Pie lighter by whipping the egg whites and using buttermilk. </p><p> Another way to make a dish more healthful is to reverse the usual proportions of ingredients, adding more vegetables than usual and maybe less cheese or eggs. For example, we've been making our Pasta with Broccoli for a long time but it has evolved over the years; now it probably ought to be called Broccoli with Pasta. The pasta is whole wheat and there's just enough olive oil and cheese to make it flavorful with a good mouth feel. </p><p> It also occurred to us to boost the nutrition in some dishes by tucking in a couple of little extras not strictly necessary in the recipe. For instance, our Breakfast Muffins are made with whole wheat flour, oat bran, and fruits, and are further enhanced with a little wheat germ or flaxseeds. For more protein, we added edamame (fresh green soybeans) to a classic stir-fry of noodles with vegetables and tofu and called it Three-Soy Sautï¿½ with Soba. </p><p> Our primary inspiration all along at Moosewood Restaurant has been ethnic grainbased cuisines that are low in saturated fats and high in plant foods. The traditional bean and corn dishes of Latin America, vegetable stews of West Africa, and tofu and vegetable sautï¿½s of Asia are all brimming with nutritious vegetables. Sometimes we adjust these dishes to accommodate ingredients that are close at hand, and sometimes we tinker with the traditional recipes and cooking methods to make them vegetarian, quicker, easier, lower in fat, or just plain tastier. Our fascination with both traditional ethnic foods and the multicultural synthesis of eclectic dishes is represented in foods as diverse as Quinoa Tabouli, New World Pizza, Thai Red Curry, Tempeh Bourgignon, and Mushroom Barley "Risotto." </p><p> We've included information we came upon in answering our own questions: Why are whole grains so much better than refined ones? What are phytonutrients? Which fats and oils are more nutritionally beneficial? Shouldn't our interest in healthful eating go beyond what's on the plate to the relationships among food, sustainable farming practices, and the environment? Is it more important to choose organic food or locally grown food? </p><p> It's a great time to eat well. Farmers' markets filled with local and organic vegetables are sprouting up everywhere, and supermarkets are spilling over with whole grain choices, bigger and better produce sections, and a variety of more healthful convenience foods. </p><p> Cooking for both health and pleasure has made creating this, our twelfth cookbook, a wonderful experience. What always remains fresh and constant is the joy we find in cooking and delight in eating. And now, we can't imagine separating the enjoyment of food from its healthfulness. Eating well feels good.

This is life on the plains in all its dynamism, cruelty and vitality, the circle of life in action. Readers will find themselves literally face to face with hyenas as they feed on a kill, with elephants communing in a watering hold, playful lion cubs, wildebeests leaping across a ravine, inquisitive monkeys who have discovered the camera and gaze directly into the lens and cheetahs peering back under their tails towards the camera. Many of these animals have actually noticed the camera, mostly by the sound of it clicking away and their interest is clearly piqued; they&#39;re certainly not accustomed to encounters with a camera on the ground of their home turf. This is primarily a visual journey through the African plains, but captions written by the author will impart interesting facts about the animals, as well as any activity of interest that may have occurred while the photo was being taken.</p><p><b>Anup Shah</b> has been a wildlife photographer based in Kenya and England for more than 30 years. His images have appeared in <i>National Geographic </i>and many European nature magazines and calendars. Shah is the coauthor of two Abrams books: <i>The Circle of Life: Wildlife on the African Savannah </i>and <i>African Odyssey: 365 Days</i>.<p></p>*Starred Review* What would it be like to travel East Africa on foot, like our hunter-gatherer ancestors? What would it be like to meet the animals of the vast Serengeti-Mara ecosystem on their own terms, as their predator, prey, or equal? Shah, who with his brother, Manoj, has been photographing the Serengeti for almost 20 years (The Circle of Life, 2003; African Odyssey, 2007), decided to explore this point of view, to try to get close to and even among the animals and to see them as they see each other. Inventing a tortoise-like remote camera and linking it to a TV monitor in his distant truck, Shah was able to trip the shutter when he saw an image he liked. The results are an amazing set of from-the-ground-up views of the iconic wildlife of the Serengeti. The camera angle, coupled with how close the camera could be placed to the animals (by using waterholes, game trails, etc.) gives an immediacy to the images that even the best use of long lenses cannot match. Wildebeest literally leap over the camera as they cross a river. We are in the middle of the action at a carcass as jackals vie with hyenas for any leftover scraps. We even come face to face with a troop of curious baboons as they investigate the camera. A wonderful new look at a much-photographed cast of animal characters. --Nancy Bent</p><h2>Lutradur and the New Fibers: Creating Mixed-Media Art with the New Spunbonded Materials</h2><p><p><i>Lutradur and the New Fibers</i> is the essential guide for mixed-media and fiber artists who are looking to get started with spunbonded textiles.</p><p>Spunbonded textiles are man-made fabrics that are strong and flexible but can also be soft and warm to the touch, making them ideal for textile art.

A number one best-seller before there even was such a thing, the bible has long been the most purchased book in history. The problem is however, that most people haven&#39;t actually read the book, and those who have don&#39;t really understand a very fundamental fact about the bible. That fact being that the bible is in all honesty, simply a very bad work of fiction.In my version I strip away all the metaphysical mumbo-jumbo and all the supposedly miraculous nonsense, and tell the story for exactly what it is. The bible is nothing more than a collection of fictional works from the minds of deluded and possibly mentally ill men, which tells the story of the most powerful wizard ever to exist. This wizard just so happens to supposedly live in another dimension, and the bible offers the stories of how this extra-dimensional wizard used to supposedly interact with mankind.Told from the perspective offered here, the absolute ridiculousness of this book becomes painfully transparent.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena.

A Chinese immigrant to Jamaica in the 1890s, Lowe revels in the lush beauty of his adoptive land. But the past confronts Lowe in everything he does, and so his history reveals itself-the tale of his exile from China, his shipboard adventures, an unwanted pregnancy and the arrangement that was made to avoid scandal. The arrangement placed Lowe in a marriage of convenience with a mysterious widow, Miss Sylvie. Lowe and Sylvie's relationship is complex, vivid, erotic, and full of secrets. Sylvie is a light-skinned black woman who, in the course of their three decades together, gives up three dark-skinned children for adoption. But Lowe's secret is much more startling, and remarkable-Lowe is actually a woman who began cross-dressing to pass as a man because it was illegal for Chinese women to emigrate. This is the story of the destruction of a far-away world: the burning of Lowe's shop and the demolition of his masks; and the creation of a dream: the building of a pagoda where culture and the past are accepted and acceptable.<br></p><p><i>The Pagoda</i> is the kind of book that revolves around a Big Secret. Give it away, and suffer the wrath of readers everywhere; keep it, and find yourself muttering enigmatic inanities about "the fluidity of identity" and so on. This much, at least, is safe to explain: Chinese immigrant Lowe runs a small village shop in post-emancipation Jamaica. Caught between black villagers and white planters and threatened on both sides, Lowe leads a tenuous, guarded existence. He marries the light-skinned Miss Sylvie, becomes estranged from his adult daughter, Liz, and has a mysterious, complex relationship with his white benefactor, Cecil. Then, one night, someone from the village burns his shop to the ground, and soon the various masks Lowe has assumed for survival begin falling away. <p> Granted, by the time the Big Secret is revealed, readers have a pretty good idea of what it is--but there are others to take its place. In <i>The Pagoda</i> Patricia Powell creates a world thick with sex and secrets and tropical smells, in prose that is by turns lyrical and claustrophobic. "The secrets inside that glimmering white house and in that village had been so tightly hemmed in that sometime soon they'd all be choking," she writes, and the reader may sometimes feel the same way. Worse, it's hard to warm up to Lowe, a man so detached from his emotions and the people around him that for years he has lived as if "through some kind of veil." </p><p> But <i>The Pagoda</i> succeeds in another, more difficult task: dramatizing the fundamental ambivalence of human relations corrupted by power. Nothing is black and white in Powell's third novel, least of all the relationship between victim and victimizer, or between savior and torturer. Lowe ends up forgiving even the man who burns down his shop, "for he saw clearly how they were all thrown in and piled up on top of one another and vying for power and trying to carve out niches." For Lowe and for all those whom his secret touches, hatred and love mix in equal measure--a volatile mixture, and one that may leave readers feeling somewhat stunned. <i>The Pagoda</i> is a fine novel, but not easy on anyone involved. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>"An exotic, richly-told tale...As the truth unfolds, it becomes clear that none of the characters are what they seem."<br>--<i>Phoenix Literary Supplement</i><p>"Powell has achieved something wonderful...Her brilliant writing, her careful sculpturing of Lowe and Miss Sylvie as 'passing' figures--one across gender, and the other across race lines-- enables us to experience the crossing of boundaries until the classifications become meaningless."<br>--Mariana Romo-Carmona, <i>MS</i> magazine</p><p>"An author of exceptional artistry and insight whose writing is extremely rich in sensual imagery."<br>--<i>Booklist</i></p><p>"An astonishing novel...a novelist of great talent and strength...an intricate, intimate, constantly surprising plot...a nuanced exploration of racial and sexual identity that transcends any specific time and place"<br>--Jonathan Wilson, <i>Boston Sunday Globe</i></p><p>"Luminously rendered...Impressively conceived...Like actors who wear masks not only to hide their identities but also to create new ones, the characters are not what they seem."<br>--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"Sumptuously written and imagined...Vivid, disorienting &amp; strange...A vastly unusual novel"<br>--Rikki Ducornet</p></p><h2>Isara: A Voyage Around Essay</h2><p>The Nobel Prize-winning novelist and playwright examines the colonial period in his native Nigeria during his father&#39;s and grandfather&#39;s generations, revealing the human complexities of political oppression</p><p>&#34;One of the finest achievements of this author&#39;s varied and brilliant career.&#34;--Chicago TribuneLike his evocative memoir Ake: The Years of Childhood , this semi-fictionalized, multigenerational family saga by the Nigerian novelist-poet-dramatist Nobel laureate is rich with the sights, sounds and textures of his native land under colonial rule. At the center is his schoolteacher father ("Essay"), unflappable, philosophical, given to browsing in exotic journals; we also meet Soyinka's grandparents locked in a sometimes tempestuous marriage, and a large cast of secondary characters, among them merchant adventurer Sipe ("Resolute Rooster"), a cripple named Node, and Ray Gunnar, a Trinidadian stowaway turned huckster. In musical, quicksilver prose, Soyinka magically re-creates a world in which local healers compete with pharmacists, and Yoruba religion vies with Christianity; African customs, rituals and traditional social relations are reshaped as Nigerians struggle to find their place in a modernizing society. After Mussolini attacked Ethiopia, the British whipped up patriotism in the Nigerian protectorate; Soyinka probes his father's generation's uneasy love-hate relationship with the British. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The First World War (3): The Western Front 1917&#x2013;1918 (Essential Histories)</h2><p>In this, the second volume covering the war on the Western Front, Peter Simkins describes the last great battles of attrition at Arras, on the Aisne and at Passchendaele in 1917. Then he moves on to relate the successive offensives launched by Germany in the spring and summer of 1918 in an effort to achieve victory or a favourable peace before American manpower proved decisive. Again, questioning and correcting several myths and long-held assumptions about the nature and conduct of war on the Western Front, the author also looks at the aftermath and legacy of the &#39;war to end wars&#39;.</p><p>This unique series studies every major war in history looking at all the aspects of war, from how it felt to be a soldier to the lasting impact of the conflict on the world around it.Peter Simkins worked at the Imperial War Museum for over 35 years and was its Senior Historian from 1976 until his retirement in 1999.

But there's Papa for company, and the two mules, Bartholomew and Thaddeus Frisco, and the big old dog that mysteriously showed up at the end of winter. Everything about her little homestead seems sheltering and secure--that is, until an ominous storm settles over the valley and threatens to take it all away. As the flood waters rise and separate the girl from her Papa, will there be anything that can save her?<br><i></i><i>The Angel Knew Papa And The Dog</i>&nbsp;is the lyrically-told, frontier wonder-tale of a little girl's faith, courage, and amazing survival in a harsh wilderness. Like a cross between&nbsp;<i>Sarah Plain and Tall</i>&nbsp;and the tales of George MacDonald,&nbsp;<i>The Angel Knew Papa and the Dog</i>&nbsp;has often been described as "a children's story for all ages," and "the perfect family read-aloud."</p><p>The remote descendant of Scottish horse-thieving ancestors, Douglas Kaine McKelvey has already bested the dubious achievements of his predecessors by authoring five published books and penning lyrics for more than 250 songs recorded by a variety of artists including Kenny Rogers, Switchfoot, and Jason Gray.&nbsp;Douglas is currently completing the manuscript for a YA sci-fi/fantasy novel, and writing a soon-to-announced work of nonfiction for Rabbit Room Press.&nbsp;McKelvey was born in New Hampshire and raised in East Texas, but now dwells in the long shadows somewhere south of Nashville with his Norwegianish wife and their three half-Norwegianish daughters who seem (strangely) to grow older with each passing year. He also has a dog. And a beard.McKelvey's first children's story is a small jewel. It is narrated by Evangeline (although readers don't know her name until the last line of the book), age seven, who lives a simple but satisfying life with her father in a remote log cabin, until the gentle rhythm of their days is ripped apart by a flood. He is swept downstream, leaving her stranded in the house with water rising fast through the floorboards. That's when she sees the angel. Calmed by its presence, Evangeline finds the wherewithal to hang on until, with the aid of a mule, a faithful old dog, and a woman in a rowboat, she is rescued and reunited with her father. Through careful attention to everyday details, McKelvey builds Evangeline's credibility. She notices things: the way a dog laps up its dinner, the way a mule twitches its ears. When she sees an angel, readers will be ready to believe her. The graceful language only appears simple; there is a disarming precision in the text, and every word belongs exactly where it has been placed. A lovely tale about the mysteries of love and faith.

A new Get Smart made-for-TV movie is scheduled to air this fall. Television historian McCrohan ( The Honeymooners' Companion ), noting that the James Bond film series triggered the mid-'60s craze for TV spy shows ( The Man from U.N.C.L.E. , I Spy ), interweaves informative interview material as she chronicles the chain of events that led to the birth of this satirical sitcom. Creators Mel Brooks and Buck Henry are profiled, along with cast members Adams, Barbara Feldon, Ed Platt, Dick Gautier et al. A chapter is devoted to the show's writers, and equal attention is given to anecdotes surrounding production activities and location shootings. In addition to a complete episode guide, the book offers lengthy lists of the memorable catchphrases ("Would you believe . . . ?") and running gags.

Amidst the usual composite portraits of the characters, episode guide (some really good, or bad, titular puns here), and production history and information, McCrohan places the series in a sociological context of American TV tastes and culture. Her profiles of and interviews with the series' actors, directors, producers, and writers interestingly reveals the interrelatedness of people responsible for TV comedy, series after series, from the Golden Age to the present morass.

Chris Lowney, a former Jesuit seminarian turned Managing Director for JP Morgan &amp; Co., shows how the pope&#x2019;s words and deeds reveal spiritual principles that have prepared him to lead the Church and influence our world&#x2014;a rapidly-changing world that requires leaders who value the human need for love, inspiration, and meaning. <br><br>Drawing on interviews with people who knew him as Father Jorge Bergoglio, SJ, Lowney challenges assumptions about what it takes to be a great leader. In so doing, he reveals the &#x201c;other-centered&#x201d; leadership style of a man whose passion is to be with people rather than set apart. Lowney offers a stirring vision of leadership to which we can all aspire in our communities, churches, companies, and families.</p><p>Chris Lowney, a former Jesuit seminarian, served as a Managing Director at J.P.

(Patrick Lencioni, President (The Table Group))<br><br>In our interconnected world where so many complain about a crisis of leadership, Chris Lowney presents the case of Pope Francis, a leader focused not on status but on mission. &nbsp;This is a powerful book for leaders of all stripes, religious and non-believers alike, who recognize the need to cultivate character and the ability to hold competing values as we navigate change, whether in business, organizations or society itself. I highly recommend it.

There she tricks the tall-tale hero Mike Fink out of his flatboat, equips it as a floating casino-showboat, and heads south to New Orleans, battling murderous bandits, British soldiers, and other scoundrels along the way. Will Jacky's carelessness and impulsive actions ultimately cause her beloved Jaimy to be left in her wake?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bold, daring, and downright fun, Jacky Faber proves once again that with resilience and can-do spirit, she can wiggle out of any scrape . . . well, almost.</p><p><b>L.

I twist my head to the side, thinking to bite the hand that holds my right arm, and so be able to draw my shiv from its sheath hidden in my left sleeve, but it is all in vain&#x2014;the marine senses my intention and pulls his hand out of range of my teeth by hauling my arm behind my back. <i>Ow! Damn! </i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I squeal and squall and struggle and squirm and curse them all to Hell and back, ten times over, and while I try to bring my heel up into the left marine&#x2019;s crotch, he is too tall for that, and the two just hold me all the tighter. All I can do now is watch as this all plays out around me, and cry out in total frustration and rage. <i>So close. Oh, Jaimy, so close . . .</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A stunned silence falls over the formerly festive crowd. <i>What? What is going on?</i> I dimly hear a parent say. <i>Who? What? Piracy?</i> I hear from another dumbfounded onlooker. <i>She&#x2019;s just a girl! Why are they holding her? How could&#x2014;?</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clarissa Howe, being the last one down the gangway, is the first to react to my arrest. She turns and charges back up, crying, &#x201c;Like hell she is! Run, Jacky! Run!&#x201d; and she launches herself at Captain Rutherford, as it was he who uttered those damning words.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crowd is now roaring its disapproval, and others come storming up the gangway.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Get her off me, dammit!&#x201d; shouts the Captain, flailing his arms against Clarissa&#x2019;s onslaught of fists, fingernails, and teeth.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let her go, you!&#x201d; snarls Clarissa, baring her teeth for an assault on Captain Rutherford&#x2019;s defenseless nose. His nose, however, is spared that grisly fate as the arm of a burly Bo&#x2019;sun&#x2019;s Mate encircles her about the waist and hauls her to the rail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But what do I do with her, Sir?&#x201d; bleats the obviously overmatched Bo&#x2019;sun, as he endures a torrent of blows and curses from the struggling form he holds.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Throw her overboard, that&#x2019;s what you do!&#x201d; roars Captain Rutherford, outraged at this unlooked-for chaos on his holy quarterdeck. &#x201c;And pull up the gangway!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clarissa shrieks as she is tossed over the rail, a shriek that is cut short as she hits the water.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the sound of the splash as Clarissa Worthington Howe enters the chill waters of Boston Harbor gave the Captain any cheer, that cheer would have been quickly dampened by the grim sight of Chrissy, Rose, Hermione, and Minerva, who had wrested themselves from their parents&#x2019; joyous embraces to string their bows at Katy Deere&#x2019;s command of &#x201c;Dianas! To me!&#x201d; and now followed her up the not-yet-pulled gangway, arrows nocked and looking for targets.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see Katy&#x2019;s eyes narrow as she sizes up the situation and pulls back and lets fly her arrow, which wings across the quarterdeck and thuds into the chest of the marine at my right hand. I expect him to drop my arm and fall to the deck, but he does not, for Katy&#x2019;s aim was true, too true&#x2014;it hit him directly in the middle of his chest where his two white leather belts cross on his breastbone. I doubt the arrow, which had a crude nail as an arrowhead, even pierced his skin. Even so, he stares down at the arrow in horror. I try to jerk free again, but his grip is still strong in spite of his amazement at the thing sticking out of his chest.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chrissy King pulls and aims and lets fly at Captain Rutherford&#x2019;s neck, but her father, charging up the gangway, shouting, <i>&#x201c;Christina! Whatever are you doing?&#x201d;</i> manages to jostle her enough to spoil her aim, and her arrow buries itself in the mast a scant few inches from the Captain&#x2019;s outraged face. I know that this is a man who has faced murderous cannon fire, cruel clouds of flying splinters, and the peppering of bullets from enemy sharpshooters, but I know also that he has faced nothing like this.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Cut the gangway!&#x201d; he screams, and two men run up with knives and cut the ropes, sacrificing the <i>Juno</i>&#x2019;s gangway to the riot. The gangway crashes down to the water, spilling the rest of the Dianas into the harbor and preventing any more arrows from being loosed in the direction of the <i>Juno.</i> Chrissy&#x2019;s father, Mr. King, also joins his daughter and her friends in the muddy water.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pandemonium rules on the dock. The rest of my Sisters, denied access to the ship, grab fruit and other things from the vendors on the wharf and wing them toward the officers on the deck of the <i>Juno,</i> often with great effect. But not, however, on my two restraining marines, who continue to hold me in an iron grip. I try stomping on their feet, but though they grunt, they do not let go.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Arrest them!&#x201d; shouts the Captain, rushing to the rail and shaking his fist at the crowd. &#x201c;You, there! Constable! Do your duty,&#x201d; he orders the confused Constable Wiggins, &#x201c;or, by God, I&#x2019;ll blockade this godforsaken harbor and starve you all to death!&#x201d; The Captain then takes a well-thrown fish to his face and staggers back, his great dignity gone, and he is reduced to wiping the fish slime out of his eye and cursing the fact he ever picked up this pack of goddamned Amazons from the middle of the goddamned ocean.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see Wiggins furrow his brow over his piggy little eyes, and I know he is thinking: <i>The female in question, that Jacky Faber: bad. Authority in the person of the British Captain: good. </i>He nods, then blows his whistle, and he and his henchmen wade into the crowd, swinging their rods.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Get her below!&#x201d; yells Captain Rutherford. &#x201c;Put her in the brig! And keep watch on her. <i>Yeow!</i> Damn!&#x201d; He ducks as another arrow whizzes by his head. It appears that not all of the Dianas went down with the gangway.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had seen Jaimy try to struggle up the gangway. <i>Oh, Jaimy! Don&#x2019;t! It won&#x2019;t work! Go back!</i> But with the crush of girls and parents, he could not gain the quarterdeck, and now with the gangway fallen, there is no hope of him boarding. <i>Could I not have spoken to him, embraced him, been with him, if even for a moment? Oh, why am I denied even that?</i> I slump down, defeated, in the hands of my captors, who begin to drag me to a hatchway.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I am pulled back from the rail, I lose sight of the people on the wharf, but I can see fish and vegetables and various animal parts continue to rain down on the formerly spotless deck, and I can hear the howls of rage and the curses that continue unabated from the crowd. A bucket arcs through the air and hits the deck, spilling bloody chicken heads across the booted toes of the still-lined-up officers. And above it all, there&#x2019;s Wiggins, sounding like an enraged bull as he bellows orders to his men, who attempt to control the mob.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the marines kicks open the hatch, and I am shoved toward the hole, but then I hear: <i>&#x201c;Release her or I&#x2019;ll kill you where you stand!&#x201d;</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I snap my head around and see that Jaimy has managed to get on deck and is facing Captain Rutherford. He must have crawled up Two Line, just like when he was a ship&#x2019;s boy, and now he&#x2019;s red in the face with fury and he is drawing his sword. <i>No, Jaimy, don&#x2019;t. There&#x2019;s too many of them!</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Captain Rutherford puffs up, his face as angry and red as Jaimy&#x2019;s, as he pulls his own sword and roars, &#x201c;A boy dares come aboard my ship, dressed in the uniform of my service, and addresses me thus? I fear it shall be you, Sir, who is killed, not me!&#x201d; I see him nod at officers who stand behind Jaimy, but Jaimy does not. A large man pins Jaimy&#x2019;s arms to his sides before he can ge...</p><h2>Collapse</h2><p>In Collapse, Jared Diamond investigates the fate of past human societies, and the lessons for our own future. What happened to the people who built the ruined temples of Angkor Wat, the long-abandonded statues of Easter Island, the crumbling Maya pyramids of the Yucatan? All saw their cultures collapse because of environmental crises. And it looks as if those crises were self-induced. As in his celebrated global best-seller Guns, Germs and Steel, Diamond brings together new evidence from a startling range of sources to tell a story with epic scope. And he lends it urgency for the modern world by probing the roots of decisions which allowed some societies to avoid ecological catastrophe, while others succumbed. How, he asks, can we learn to be survivors?</p><p>Jared Diamond's <i>Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed</i> is the glass-half-empty follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i>. While <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> explained the geographic and environmental reasons why some human populations have flourished, <i>Collapse</i> uses the same factors to examine why ancient societies, including the Anasazi of the American Southwest and the Viking colonies of Greenland, as well as modern ones such as Rwanda, have fallen apart. Not every collapse has an environmental origin, but an eco-meltdown is often the main catalyst, he argues, particularly when combined with society's response to (or disregard for) the coming disaster. Still, right from the outset of <i>Collapse</i>, the author makes clear that this is not a mere environmentalist's diatribe. He begins by setting the book's main question in the small communities of present-day Montana as they face a decline in living standards and a depletion of natural resources. Once-vital mines now leak toxins into the soil, while prion diseases infect some deer and elk and older hydroelectric dams have become decrepit. On all these issues, and particularly with the hot-button topic of logging and wildfires, Diamond writes with equanimity. <p> Because he's addressing such significant issues within a vast span of time, Diamond can occasionally speak too briefly and assume too much, and at times his shorthand remarks may cause careful readers to raise an eyebrow. But in general, Diamond provides fine and well-reasoned historical examples, making the case that many times, economic and environmental concerns are one and the same. With <i>Collapse</i>, Diamond hopes to jog our collective memory to keep us from falling for false analogies or forgetting prior experiences, and thereby save us from potential devastations to come. While it might seem a stretch to use medieval Greenland and the Maya to convince a skeptic about the seriousness of global warming, it's exactly this type of cross-referencing that makes <i>Collapse</i> so compelling. <i>--Jennifer Buckendorff</i></p>"Diamond&#x2019;s most influential gift may be his ability to write about geopolitical and environmental systems in ways that don&#x2019;t just educate and provoke, but entertain."<br> <i>&#x2014;The Seattle Times</i> <br><br> "Extremely persuasive . . . replete with fascinating stories, a treasure trove of historical anecdotes [and] haunting statistics."<br> <i>&#x2014;The Boston Globe</i> <br><br> "Extraordinary in erudition and originality, compelling in [its] ability to relate the digitized pandemonium of the present to the hushed agrarian sunrises of the far past."<br> <i>&#x2014;The New York Times Book Review</i></p><h2>The Atlantean Irish: Ireland&#39;s Oriental and Maritime Heritage</h2><p>A revised, expanded and newly illustrated edition of the book that questions the Irish Celtic heritage.</p><p>&#34;Bob Quinn is as indefatigable as he is enthusiastic ... his book makes a very good read.&#34;</p><h2>Unfinished Revolution: Daniel Ortega and Nicaragua&#39;s Struggle for Liberation</h2><p><p>Together with his brother Humberto, Daniel Ortega Saavedra masterminded the only victorious Latin American revolution since Fidel Castro&#x2019;s in Cuba. Following the triumphant 1979 Nicaraguan revolution, Ortega was named coordinator of the governing junta, and then in 1984 was elected president by a landslide in the country&#x2019;s first free presidential election. The future was full of promise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yet the United States was soon training, equipping, and financing a counterrevolutionary force inside Nicaragua while sabotaging its crippled economy. The result was a decade-long civil war. By 1990, Nicaraguans dutifully voted Ortega out and the preferred candidate of the United States in. And Nicaraguans grew poorer and sicker.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then, in 2006, Daniel Ortega was reelected president. He was still defiantly left-wing and deeply committed to reclaiming the lost promise of the Revolution. Only time will tell if he succeeds, but he has positioned himself as an ally of Castro and Hugo Chï¿½vez, while life for many Nicaraguans is finally improving. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfinished Revolution is the first full-length biography of Daniel Ortega in any language. Drawing from a wealth of untapped sources, it tells the story of Nicaragua&#x2019;s continuing struggle for liberation through the prism of the Revolution&#x2019;s most emblematic yet enigmatic hero. </p></p><p>Kenneth E. Morris is the author of two previous political biographies: <i>Jimmy Carter, American Moralist</i> and <i>Bonhoeffer&#x2019;s Ethic of Discipleship</i>. He has taught at a number of colleges and universities.Ortega has been called many things - revolutionary, political leader, even child molester - but poet? According to Ortega, "In Nicaragua everybody is considered a poet until he proves to the contrary," and Morris's inclusion of the leader's poems go a long ways toward recasting the man that George W. Bush called "an animal at a garden party." Yet Morris also reminds us of Ortega the killer, chronicling his crimes and prison life, where he acquired traits for clandestine action and matured as a revolutionary strategist. Freed in 1976, Ortega soon led a bloody but successful revolution, overthrowing the government and bringing the Sandinistas to power, but ultimately finding the state "remote, inefficient, and a little clueless" and out of money. "McDonald's customers were asked to return their paper cups to be washed and reused - if water supply was available." Ortega has spent a lifetime dedicated to improving the lives of Nicaragua's poor and remains, in Morris's view, innocent of the aggrandizement so prevalent in third world countries. But for all of Morris's accurate reporting, the book lacks enough color and depth to cast Ortega as a character - whether admirable or otherwise. <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Toklas was written in 1933 by Gertrude Stein in the guise of an autobiography authored by Alice B. Toklas, who was her lover. It is a fascinating insight into the art scene in Paris as the couple were friends with Paul Cezanne, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. They begin the war years in England but return to France, volunteering for the American Fund for the French Wounded, driving around France, helping the wounded and homeless. After the war Gertrude has an argument with T. S. Eliot after he finds one of her writings inappropriate. They become friends with Sherwood Anderson and Ernest Hemingway. It was written to make money and was indeed a commercial success. However, it attracted criticism, especially from those who appeared in the book and didn&#39;t like the way they were depicted.</p><p>Abridged by Joseph Hett (@jehosafet).</p><h2>Drafting and Design Simplified</h2><p>Drafting and Design Simplified (edited by Sarah Sacks Dunn) is your Step-by-Step Guide to Drafting &amp; Design <br><br>Declare your independence and find out how to draft and design your own quilts!

This alternative body of literature falls under the category of &#34;apocrypha,&#34; which means &#34;hidden&#34; or &#34;secret,&#34; and it offers fascinating insights into the early Christian world. But these early Christian apocryphal works are more than historical curiosities. The canonical Bible is one of the most influential books in all of Western history, but you might be surprised to find out how many gaps and contradictions the New Testament contains. Much of what we know about Jesus today actually comes from these apocryphal sources, so The Apocryphal Jesus is your chance to learn the true breadth and depth of the early Christian world. Over the course of 24 revealing lectures, Professor David Brakke of The Ohio State University takes you on a tour of this world and surveys the major apocryphal works that have survived. Here you will examine the cult of the Virgin Mary through the Proto-Gospel of James, survey the Gnostic vision presented in the Gospel of Judas, encounter a radically different view of Jesus&#39; teaching in the Gospel of Thomas, and more. By exploring the stories and ideas that shaped the foundations of Christian thought-and continue to influence Christianity today-The Apocryphal Jesus is a must-have course for skeptics, seekers, and believers interested in the foundations of Christianity.</p><p></p><h2>Big Dreams Collection: 3-Book Box Set</h2><p><b>Three bestselling picture books by Peter H.

Or rather, she&#x2019;s not sure. Mind you, this is no fickle woman and this is not an admission she makes lightly. Connie and Douglas have been together, and happily so, for almost two decades. They have a son, Albie, more a chip off his artistic mum than biochemist dad, and that has strained the father-son dynamic. Will an ill-timed family vacation provide the opportunity Douglas needs to repair both relationships? With humor and with heart, David Nicholls of <i>One Day</i> fame takes us through every bumbling but well-meaning attempt in service to this goal. Lest you think the premise wreaks of a rom-com starring Hugh Grant, it is not a story tied up with a neat little bow. Nor is the precarious marriage portrayed as a consequence of cinematically-friendly scenes like slamming doors, flying frying pans, or people leaving the toilet seat up on purpose. Instead, <i>Us</i> delicately and intelligently untangles one of the more complex, heart-wrenching and relatable of relationship struggles&#x2014;one in which there isn&#x2019;t a villain to blame. You&#x2019;ll be rooting for this family, and for another fine achievement from David Nicholls. <i>&#x2013;Erin Kodicek </i></p><p>David Nicholls brings the wit and intelligence that graced his <em>New York Times </em>bestseller one day to a compellingly human, deftly humorous new novel about what holds marriages and families together&#x2014;and what happens when everything threatens to fall apart.</p><p>Douglas Petersen may be mild mannered, but behind his reserve lies a sense of humor that, against all odds, seduces beautiful Connie into a second date . . . and eventually into marriage.

An Indian messenger tells Fr. John O'Malley, the pastor of St. Francis Mission, to inform the Shoshones and Arapahos they must pay a $250,000 ransom for the rock art, which was chiseled off the wall. Father John obliges, but also alerts the FBI. Meanwhile, attorney Vicky Holden decides to represent Travis Birdsong, who's serving time for killing his alleged partner in a glyph theft seven years earlier. Enraged locals, who believe Travis didn't get a fair trial, want Vicky's firm to concentrate on keeping a logging company from desecrating Red Cliff Canyon. Father John's conflicted feelings for Vicky, who's not sure she wants to stay with her partner, Adam Lone Eagle, and the arrival of a retired pedophile priest at the mission help keep the emotional temperature high. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When his father, a travelling salesman, moved with his family to St Louis some years later, both he and his sister found it impossible to settle down to city life. He entered college during the Depression and left after a couple of years to take a clerical job in a shoe company. He stayed there for two years, spending the evenings writing. He entered the University of Iowa in 1938 and completed his course, at the same time holding a large number of part-time jobs of great diversity. He received a Rockefeller Fellowship in 1940 for his play Battle of Angels, and he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1948 and 1955. Among his many other plays Penguin have published The Glass Menagerie (1944), A Streetcar Named Desire (1947), Summer and Smoke (1948), The Rose Tattoo (1951), Camino Real (1953), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955), Orpheus Descending (1957), Sweet Bird of Youth (1959), Period of Adjustment (1960), The Night of the Iguana (1961), The Milk Train Doesn&#39;t Stop Here Anymore (1963; revised 1964) and Small Craft Warnings (1972).</p><h2>Out of the Ocean</h2><p>Open this book and walk along the ocean shore. If you look carefully, you might find all kinds of things. Some--like shells and sea glass--will be small enough to fit in your hand. Others--like the sun and the sky and the waves--will be too big to carry home. But no matter what your journey holds, you&#x2019;ll soon discover that looking for the ocean&#x2019;s treasures can be as important as finding them.<br></p><p>"My mother says you can ask the ocean to bring you something. If you look, she says, you might find it." So begins the child narrator in Debra Frasier's <i>Out of the Ocean</i>, a loving tribute to the sea. For over 35 years, Frasier's family lived just north of Vero Beach, Florida, in a house overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. During that time, she combed the shore, took many pictures, and finally wrote this beachy paean. Close-up photographs of sand allow readers to see every raspy grain, and cut-paper collages splash across the sandy, shell-strewn background to form incoming surf or dune plants such as periwinkle and hibiscus. As readers walk along the shore with the author, we find beach glass, flotsam, a little jetsam, pelican feathers, black skate egg pouches, and other shore-side marvels. The little girl asks the ocean to show her treasures like these, but her mother asks for things that are too big to carry home--water, the sun, the moon, the sound of waves. A glossary in the back provides more information on shells, finding messages in bottles, and egg pouches, and plants and trees, in addition to things too big to carry home. If you've ever wanted to introduce the ocean to a child who's never seen it, this book captures the dreamy sights, smells, sounds, and textures.

The mystical and transcendent experience that followed set him off on an exploration that was to produce a revolutionary body of work about the inner reaches of the human mind. Huxley was decades ahead of his time in his anticipation of the dangers modern culture was creating through explosive population increase, headlong technological advance, and militant nationalism, and he saw psychedelics as the greatest means at our disposal to &#x201c;remind adults that the real world is very different from the misshapen universe they have created for themselves by means of their culture-conditioned prejudices.&#x201d; Much of Huxley&#x2019;s writings following his 1953 mescaline experiment can be seen as his attempt to reveal the power of these substances to awaken a sense of the sacred in people living in a technological society hostile to mystical revelations. <br> <br>Moksha, a Sanskrit word meaning &#x201c;liberation,&#x201d; is a collection of the prophetic and visionary writings of Aldous Huxley. It includes selections from his acclaimed novels Brave New World and Island, both of which envision societies centered around the use of psychedelics as stabilizing forces, as well as pieces from <em>The Doors of Perception</em> and <em>Heaven and Hell</em>, his famous works on consciousness-expansion. Also included are magazine articles, interviews, letters, and scientific papers that vividly demonstrate the evolution of his ideas and offer an engrossing record of the journey. <br> <br>MICHAEL HOROWITZ and CYNTHIA PALMER are the directors of the Fitz Hugh Ludlow Memorial Library in San Francisco, the only library in the world devoted exclusively to the literature of mind-altering drugs.

A murdered woman&#x2019;s daughter, Christina, falls down a truly black and greasy rabbit hole in the wake of her mother&#x2019;s death that leads through bio-engineering, weather manipulation, Naval Research and Weapons, Atmospheric research connected to DARPA and through London, Virginia and Hawaii. The birthplace of her mother&#x2019;s murder, when she finds it, lies within the circle of Operation Paperclip scientists still working in London in the 80s and 90s. Christina and those she joins with along the way struggle on to find answers despite being chased by Blackhawks, run off roads, betrayed by allies...her comrades include a Canadian civil rights activist who styles himself &#x2018;Amistad,&#x2019; an old Brazilian psychic emigrated to Australia, and a chemist-turned-activist also on the trail of these psychotics; half a dozen ancient men who form a sinister cabal. The Gatekeepers are scientists, liaisons with the Joint Chiefs, a global industrialist of unmatched power and wealth, a US Secretary of Agriculture. While Christina is on her own mission to flush out those who murdered her mother, Tim Verzet, firebomber and ex-military pilot infiltrates the very nerve-center of the global poisoning operation trying to make it implode from the inside. One very well-placed traitor just about brings the whole effort down but in the end, the Achilles heel of the entire campaign, a campaign which has actually been in place for decades, is a very small group, led by one pilot on the inside.</p><p></p><h2>Playing God: The Evolution of a Modern Surgeon</h2><p><b>What does it mean to be a doctor?</b><br><br>&#x201c;I am a doctor.&#x201d;<br> <br>Every year, thousands of medical school graduates utter these four simple words.

In 2004, Ron Howard made his novel The Last Ride into a feature film, The Missing. Thomas Eidson lives in Boston, Massachusetts.Samuel Jones, a 76-year-old Indian warrior, is dying. As his last act, he wants to make amends with Maggie Baldwin, the daughter he deserted more than 30 years ago when he left to live with the Indians. But even in 1886, New Mexico life is dangerous. Soon after Samuel arrives at the Baldwin ranch, renegade Apaches severely wound Maggie's husband and kidnap her daughter, Lily. The locals who set out after Lily are caught in an ambush and decimated, forcing Maggie and Samuel to form an alliance to pursue and reclaim Lily. Samuel, despite his age and illness, is still a formidable warrior, but he knows his magic is dwindling rapidly. He must summon all his faith to reunite his daughter's family. Similarly, Maggie must overcome her dogmatic Christian faith and her personal bitterness to forgive and understand this man who abandoned her but is now willing to die for her. An outstanding adventure tale, this second entry in an outstanding western trilogy--<i>St. Agnes' Stand</i> opened the set--offers a thought-provoking take on the enduring if often cliche{&#x201a;}d notion of "family values." Arguing eloquently that love can transcend time and pain and bitterness when strengthened by acceptance and faith, Eidson's epic, like <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, deserves a readership well beyond the boundaries of its genre. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i></p><h2>Hunting with Hemingway: Based on the Stories of Leicester Hemingway</h2><p>The niece of Ernest Hemingway presents the transcribed accounts of the Hemingway brothers&#39; daring and sometimes reckless safari adventures, as well as her reactions and coming-to-terms with the suicide of her father Leicester.</p><p>Hilary Hemingway's father, Leicester Hemingway, committed suicide in 1982, 21 years after his famous older brother, Ernest. In 1997, Hilary's mother died and left her a mysterious audiocassette of Leicester telling hunting stories at the family home in Miami Beach. Are the stories true? Interjections by Leicester's wife and a good friend suggest they are well-polished yarns, designed to deflect Ernest idolaters like the unnamed English professor whose nervous laugh and awkward questions punctuate the recording. Does it matter if they're true? "These stories are really good," says Hilary's 7-year-old daughter. "I even like them and I really hate hunting." Indeed, Leicester's suspenseful tales of stalking crocodiles, ostriches, and tigers with his adored big brother evoke the glamorous Hemingway world of men pitted against beasts as a test of courage and grace under pressure. Listening to the recording on her daughter's purple Barney tape player, the author rediscovers "the big, laughing man" who taught her "to enjoy whatever life might throw at me"; she then comes to terms with his suicide in the face of a debilitating illness.

With more than fifteen killings attributed to him, and given his involvement in the Butch Cassidy gang, &#34;Kid Curry&#34; was as renowned a figure as you were likely to find west of the Mississippi. Short of stature yet enormous in reputation, after Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid fled for South America, Logan became the most wanted outlaw in the United States. He was finally captured--only to escape from his Tennessee prison in 1903.

Beginning first in his native Italy and then expanding all over the world, the movement has created a powerful force for change. &nbsp;<br>The essential argument of this book is that food is an avenue towards freedom. This uplifting and humanistic message is straightforward: if people can feed themselves, they can be free. In other words, if people can regain control over access to their food&#x2014;how it is produced, by whom, and how it is distributed&#x2014;then that can lead to a greater empowerment in all channels of life. Whether in the Amazon jungle talking with tribal elders or on rice paddies in rural Indonesia, the author engages the reader through the excitement of his journeys and the passion of his mission. &nbsp;<br>Here, Petrini reports upon some of the success stories that he has observed firsthand. From Chiapas to Puglia, Morocco to North Carolina, he has witnessed the many ways different peoples have dealt with food problems. This book allows us to learn from these case studies and lays out models for the future.</p><p><b>Carlo Petrini</b> is the author of <i>Slow Food Nation</i> and the founder of the Slow Food organization, which counts 100,000 members in 150 countries. Petrini was named a &#x201c;European Hero&#x201d; by <i>Time</i> and a &#x201c;Champion of the Earth&#x201d; by the United Nations.&nbsp;In May 2016, the United Nations named him "FAO Special Ambassador Zero Hunger for Europe.""Petrini&#x2019;s central message is that <b>everyone who eats should only buy food that is good, clean, and fair</b>. &nbsp;Without being didactic, the author vigorously stresses the importance of all three components in his <b>discussion of food policy</b>, as well as case studies from all over the globe."<br>-<i>ForewordReviews.com</i><br><br>"[Carlo Petrini] exudes so much joy, hope, and optimism in his new book that it's hard not to be swept away by his <b>impassioned arguments for social, political, and environmental justice</b>. . . <i>Food &amp; Freedom </i>celebrates boundless pleasures.

For the first time ever, a comprehensive plan is provided, from effective conservation techniques to producing your own energy.<br><br>Starting with the energy audit, Ed shows us how to create a game plan for resource conservation in the home. Then, once an adequate baseline of resource use is achieved, he leads us into more in-depth eco-matters, such as the production of alternative energy, and how to use solar and wind energy and a geothermal pump. As Ed&#x2019;s guide continues, the focus then turns to sustainable lifestyle management choices, such as home gardening, and guidelines on creating a green nursery for your children. This book covers it all&#x2013;small to large&#x2013;in plain language and in a progression from resource conservation to energy production and lifestyle management that makes both environmental and fiscal sense.<br><br>There&#x2019;s something here for everyone&#x2013;new and experienced environmentalists alike&#x2013;and Ed walks you through every step of the way with helpful sidebars that outline costs and paybacks, as well as essays detailing his experiences of completing these eco-projects on his own home.</p><p>ED BEGLEY, JR., is a veteran actor and a committed environmentalist. He resides in Los Angeles in a self-sufficient home powered by solar energy.I know, for a lot of folks, it&#x2019;s really tempting to go straight to the shiny, sexy stuff, like installing solar panels or a whole-house fan or geothermal heating and cooling. But before you mount solar panels on your roof, before you invest in a residential wind turbine, before you buy new windows, before you install more insulation&#x2013;in fact, before you spend a dime on changes to your home and your lifestyle&#x2013;you&#x2019;ll want to have someone perform a green energy audit on your home.<br><br>This audit will identify the areas where you can <i>conserve </i>energy, where you can become more efficient. This type of audit will establish a baseline: It&#x2019;ll give a snapshot of where you are right now. I promise you, the time and money you invest in an energy audit will pay off several times over.<br><br>In order to take your level of green up a notch, <i>first </i>you want to conserve. Establish a baseline, see the challenges you face with your home, and see where you can improve the situation. Then go from your baseline to a lower energy-usage position <i>before </i>you do anything else. First you want to work to get your use of electricity down to the lowest possible level. Only then can you start to think about creating your own electricity on-site. Otherwise, you&#x2019;re just going to be overproducing electricity, and that&#x2019;s wasteful in many, many ways.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s begin with some ways to establish that all-important baseline.<br><br><b>DIFFERENT TYPES OF GREEN AUDITS<br></b><br>The best way to figure out your home&#x2019;s energy performance is to perform a <i>green home energy</i> <i>audit. </i>This term is used a lot these days. Some people call it a green home audit. Some call it an energy audit, but the terms are not always used to describe the same types of activities.<br><br>Actually, there&#x2019;re all different kinds of green home audits and energy audits. Some audits look at your electricity use. Some look at your natural gas use. Some look at your water use. Some look at all of the above. Some also consider your recycling habits and your waste management. And some go so far as to consider your overall carbon footprint.<br><br>For simplicity&#x2019;s sake, we can break down the offerings into three levels of green home audits. From the most basic to the most detailed and involved, you can<br><br>1. use an online resource to get a general idea of your home&#x2019;s energy use<br>2. contact your local utility company for an audit, which is often free<br>3. get a professional green audit, in which a company sends representatives to your home to evaluate your energy usage, water usage, and more<br><br>Another really valuable type of home audit is a green home health issues audit. Many professional energy auditors will address potential health threats from your home during their audits, too.<br><br><b>TAP INTO FREE RESOURCES FIRST<br></b>When you look at the different levels of green home audits, the first two typically are free&#x2013;at no cost to you, the consumer. So start with the free options and consider the results.<br><br>A great example of a free audit is on the Energy Star website (see Resources, page 340). In the website&#x2019;s section on home improvement, you&#x2019;ll find the interactive Energy Star Home Energy Yardstick. You&#x2019;ll need to have your last twelve months of utility bills (or ask your utility company or companies to get you a twelve-month summary). Plus, you&#x2019;ll have to enter some basic information about your house, including the following:<br><br>ï¿½ your ZIP code<br>ï¿½ your home&#x2019;s age<br>ï¿½ its square footage<br>ï¿½ the number of occupants<br><br>The site will tell you how your home&#x2019;s energy efficiency compares with similar homes across the country, and it provides recommendations for energy-saving home improvements.<br><br>If you want more detail, another great free resource online is ENERGY Guide (see Resources, page 340). Check that site to see if your electric or gas company offers a &#x201c;personalized energy center.&#x201d; Many utilities from all across the United States are included. Once you choose the link for your utility, you can get some pretty helpful information.<br><br><b>UTILITY COMPANY AUDITS<br></b>Another option for a free audit is to contact your local utility company directly and see if it offers home-inspection-type audits for its customers. Many utility companies will do this to help you conserve energy and to help you better understand your utility bills, too.<br><br>Naturally, these types of audits focus specifically on the service provided by the particular utility company. So if the utility provides both natural gas and electricity, the audit will cover both.<br><br>These audits can be very helpful. For example, Silicon Valley Power (see Resources, page 340) in Santa Clara, California, will send a specialist to customers&#x2019; homes for free. The audit is quick and painless. It takes just an hour or less. The specialist will walk through your home and evaluate your refrigerator (or refrigerators), your dishwasher, your washer and dryer, and your lighting. The specialist also will ask questions about your energy habits, how many people live in your home, and other important information.<br><br>The specialist will come armed with copies of two years&#x2019; worth of your utility bills. They&#x2019;re looking for any trends in usage, including seasonal shifts with your winter heating and summer air-conditioning.<br><br>&#x201c;The auditor usually will give recommendations for ways to save energy right at the audit,&#x201d; says Leslie Mackenzie of Silicon Valley Power. And it includes information on ways to save money when you invest in newer, more efficient appliances and other items. &#x201c;We talk to people about our rebate programs at the time, if we feel that they&#x2019;re appropriate. We have rebates for attic insulation, whole-house fans, refrigerator purchase and recycling, LCD monitors, and recently added solar attic fans, ceiling fans, and the new energy-efficient pool pumps.&#x201d;<br><br>To encourage customers to get these free audits and take steps to conserve energy use, some utility company auditors also give homeowners compact fluorescent lightbulbs and other useful items to help them save energy&#x2013;all part of the package.<br><br>A free audit may not be the most in-depth energy audit available, but it&#x2019;s obviously well worth sixty minutes of your time.<br><br><b>HOUSEHOLD IMPACT CALCULATOR<br></b>Free utility company energy audits are really useful, and so are some of the quick and easy online tools. When you&#x2019;re ready to investigate even further, there&#x2019;s one other great and still free tool: the most in-depth free resource I&#x2019;ve run across, which is on Low Impact Living&#x2019;s website.<br><br>So before you have someone visit your house, I highly recommend using this site&#x2019;s free household impact calculator (see Resources, page 340). It covers all the environmental impacts for your household&#x2013;carbon emissions, energy usage, water usage, trash production, water runoff on your property, and even more.<br><br>To get you thinking about things you might want to change, the calculator asks some really valuable questions about:<br><br>ï¿½the age of your heating and cooling systems<br>ï¿½how often you use your air- conditioning<br>ï¿½how many loads of laundry you do each week<br>ï¿½how many times you run the dishwasher<br>ï¿½how many refrigerators you have, how old they are, and how large they are<br>ï¿½how many of your lightbulbs are compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs)<br>ï¿½your recycling habits<br>ï¿½information about your yard<br>ï¿½how many vehicles you have, including their year, make, model, and annual mileage<br>ï¿½how many short, medium, and long airplane flights you take each year<br><br>The site then gives you a LILI&#x2013;that is, a Low Impact Living Index number. This score lets you know how you compare with other homes in your area, and it reflects not just your carbon footprint but your entire environmental footprint. The average score is 100. The lower this number is, the better.<br><br>The site then provides many suggestions regarding how to lower your Low Impact Living Index number. Some of the relatively simple suggestions include, for instance,<br><br>ï¿½installing low- flow showerheads<br>ï¿½installing ultraefficient toilets<br>ï¿½installing a high- efficiency dishwasher<br>ï¿½replacing your incandescent lightbulbs<br>ï¿½increasing ceiling insulation<br>ï¿½planting shade trees<br>ï¿½reducing the temperature setting on your water heater<br>ï¿½buying carbon offsets for airplane travel<br><br>Alongside each suggestion, you&#x2019;ll find a number indicating how much the change will lower your LILI score. I find this to be a really helpful resource. It goes into considerably more detail than the other free resources I&#x2019;ve found.<br><br><b>A PROFESSIONAL GREEN HOME AUDIT<br></b>Once you&#x2019;ve taken advantage of all the free resources and you&#x2019;ve gotten a general idea of your home&#x2019;s energy consumption, the next step is to hire a professional to visit your home to perform a thorough green audit. I can&#x2019;t emphasize enough the importance of getting an expert to come out and do a home energy audit.<br><br>Performing green home audits is a pretty new field, and different companies within this field do things differently. Some will mostly look at your heating and cooling systems. Some will bring out some fancy equipment&#x2013;duct testers, blower door testers&#x2013;to figure out how well your home is sealed and insulated. Some will look at your appliances and your lighting, both indoors and out. Some will look at your water usage and your carbon footprint as a whole.<br><br>There&#x2019;s one specific tool that you want to make sure these folks have, and that&#x2019;s an infrared gun that can measure heat. If your home auditor doesn&#x2019;t have an infrared gun, tell them thanks, but the audit isn&#x2019;t worth a penny without it. This infrared gun is a heat- sensing camera, basic...</p><h2>Bland Ambition: From Adams to Quayle--The Cranks, Criminals, Tax Cheats, and Golfers Who Made It to Vice President</h2><p>Profiles the individuals who have become vice president of the the United States</p><p>Yes, it's true, very often in our nation's history, the second-highest official has been nothing more than an outright crook. That is, when he's not been an adulterer, booze hound, or, more usually, a party hack from way back. In Tally's genuinely entertaining and informative history of all 44 (so far) vice presidents, we learn how each of these men has seen his "bland ambition" fulfilled. Given the number of times a vice president has been elevated to the Oval Office upon the death or resignation of a president, it's amazing how little thought has been given to a veep's qualifications for that responsibility.

This play has been performed around the world, winning the Best Foreign Play of the Year award in Germany. Ms. Martin&#39;s other collected works include Vital Signs and What Mama Don&#39;t Know. Her full-length plays include Cementville, the Pulitzer nominated Keely and Du, which won the 1994 American Theatre Critics Association New Play Award, Criminal Hearts and Middle-Aged White Guys.While there is some confusion as to whether Jane Martin is a pseudonym for a male playwright, these plays speak to women's frustrations with male-dominated society. They are darkly humorous and biting. All but one tells the story of sometimes bizarre women in hard circumstances striving to overcome and survive. The most striking of all the plays is Keely and Du, which involves a young woman who was raped by her ex-husband. On her way to obtain an abortion, Keely is kidnapped by a group of anti-abortion Christians. She is handcuffed to a bed and told that she will be kept captive until the birth of her child. Du is an aged nurse who has been given the assignment of looking after Keely. During the months of Keely's pregnancy, the two women begin to listen to each other's beliefs. The play ends with a self-abortion by Keely while Du is imprisoned. An evocative collection of plays. For large public and academic collections.?J. Sara Paulk, Tifton-Tift Cty.

In an endnote on Frost, the poem is acknowledged as being a metaphor for "the impetuous spirit of youth." This metaphor is implied visually in Lang's illustrations. The bold, almost silhouetted figures of a girl and her dog watching the colt are rendered in matte colors with no or faint white outlining and evoke the cold, muted brightness of the early winter farm landscape. The artist frames the pictures so that the child's mother only occasionally appears at the periphery of the double-page spreads. The narrator seems to be the girl, who notices the colt's play and the fact that his mother isn't around, but who also plays in the snow unattended. Yet readers know that the child's mother is always at hand and, sure enough, Lang brings the mare to collect her young at the end. It is this visual layer to the text that makes this poem an appealing story for children. Lang makes her vision of this poem haunting enough to suggest new possibilities of interpretation as children grow up and mature.<br><i>Nina Lindsay, Oakland Public Library, CA</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.With a muted palette of pastel and earth tones, Lang's serene illustrations of a New England landscape give Frost's haunting, potentially disturbing poem a happy ending. Walking in a snowfall, a girl and a woman who appears to be her mother spy a skittish colt frightened by the weather. As the animal bolts across a field, the poem's unnamed voice asks, "Where is his mother? He can't be out alone." Frost's concluding words leave the young horse's fate uncertain: "Whoever it is that leaves him out so late,/ When other creatures have gone to stall and bin,/ Ought to be told to come and take him in." Lang, however, answers the rhetorical question by introducing a concerned mare in the distance that takes her place by the frightened colt's side. Lang's collage-style spreads with large blocks of color are tranquil renderings of a seemingly sedate colt and do not effectively allow readers to experience the strength of Frost's words (to hear "the miniature thunder where he fled," for example). The poet suggests a colt fearful of the heavy snowfall, yet the illustrations convey a perfect pattern of spare white polka dots. Although the artist's interpretation may quell her audience, the artwork divests the poem of its drama and urgency.

Buying and selling Amish quilts led to collecting them, and inevitably to a curiosity about the milieu in which they were produced. For the past six years she has conducted extensive research for this book. Along the way she has lectured and written articles about the Amish and their quilts.<b>Preface</b><br>Much has been written about the Amish and their quilts in recent years. Quilts have been collected, photographed, displayed, bought and sold for some time now. Today there are only a few old quilts left in the homes of Amish families. Many Amish have sold their quilts to pickers and antique dealers who have filled the marketplace with Amish quilts of all ages, sizes, and descriptions. In the rush to gather these quilts for sale, often little attention has been paid to the oral and written histories that accompany these textiles.<br><i>The Amish Quilt </i>draws together the body of available information about the Amish and their textile traditions. Much of what is presented here comes from interviews and conversations with Amish families and with people whose lives have touched the Amish community. Research in county courthouse records and public libraries provided other valuable data and insight. Finally, there is the information based on seeing these quilts in Amish homes, watching them come out of blanket chests or off beds. When women were asked about the age or history of their quilts they had much to say. By listening to their stories, handling thousands of quilts, examining fabrics and comparing quilts made in different communities, we can begin to develop a larger sense of the Amish and their quilts. <br>--Eve Wheatcroft Granick, April 1989<br><b>Introduction</b><br>The quilts made by Amish women in the years between the last quarter of the 19th century and the midpoint of the 20th century represent a unique achievement in American quiltmaking. The work of a small and relatively insulated group of women, these textiles are an expression of both personal and group sensibilities about the use of color and design. Their creation and use in the home are part of a way of life that centers on simplicity and places a high value on symbolism.<br>Textiles provide visual clues about the interests and concerns of any cultural group. They offer a subtle reflection of the emotional makeup of a group, as well as its individual members. The motifs, colors, and designs in the quilts made by Amish women also reflect the group's history and its collective outlook on life.<br>As a society committed to simplicity and humility, the Amish place certain restrictions on the practice of the decorative arts. Rather than being vehicles for bold self-expression or individual achievement, Amish quilts must serve a utilitarian purpose while remaining within a seemingly narrow set of aesthetic boundaries.<br>The Amish are not ascetics; they do value well-made objects and find great satisfaction in the creation of useful and decorative works. They do believe, however, that their enjoyment of the material world must be weighed against the larger claims of their religious faith. The tensions that arise out of the effort to maintain a proper balance between pride and humility, and between simplicity and more complex, "worldly" choices are well expressed in Amish quilts.<br>We enjoy these quilts for their decorative or visual impact and marvel at their surprising similarity to works of modern art. Their appeal is immediate and apparent to even the most casual viewer. If, however, we limit our interest solely to what we see, we lose a large measure of the meaning of these textiles. By examining Amish quilts in the light of their particular cultural and historical background, we can understand and appreciate both the objects themselves and the unique society that has created them.<br>As a group that has chosen to live apart from the ways of the world, the Amish must be both aware of and sensitive to that world which they strive to avoid. Amish quilts reflect both the interaction with and the avoidance of "English" culture, which the group has practiced successfully for two and a half centuries. These quilts bridge two world, enriching our vision of the Amish community and illuminating the larger world of American quiltmaking and textile arts.<br><br></p><h2>Sons and Soldiers: The Untold Story of the Jews Who Escaped the Nazis and Returned With the U.S. Army to Fight Hitler</h2><p><p><strong><em>NEW YORK TIMES</em>&nbsp;Bestseller</strong></p><p><strong>"An irresistible history of the WWII Jewish refugees who returned to Europe to fight the Nazis.&#x201d; &#x2014;<em>Newsday</em></strong></p><p>They were young Jewish boys who escaped from Nazi-occupied Europe and resettled in America.

Each of the seven chapters covers a different time period in chronological order (a detailed time line is included in each), starting with "The Beginning," or the last Ice Age 10,000 years ago during which the first humans are believed to have arrived in North America via the Bering Strait. One chapter describes in handsome spreads the diverse and varied cultures within geographic regions, from the early Mound Builders to the Arctic and Subarctic tribes. Three chapters focus on the coming of the Europeans, the resulting conflict, and the often devastating impact that contact had on tribal life. The remaining two chapters describe life on reservations, assimilation, and the American Indian Movement, which started in the 1960s and remains active today. The glossy photographs, colorful drawings, and easily accessible paragraphs are similar in layout to the "Eyewitness" books (DK) and make for an easy-to-use overall package. However, this book is much longer and broader in scope than titles in that series and is best suited to more mature readers for browsing or as a supplemental resource for reports.&#x2014;<i>Madeline J.

She argues convincingly that the way forward is not harsher prisons or letting commercial corporations make money out of privatized prisons. Instead, a new criminal justice agenda should involve minimal use of the criminal justice system, with policing accountable to local communities, imprisonment as a last resort, morally educative penalties that benefit victims rather than just punishing the perpetrators, and a renewed emphasis on social justice and economic development that benefits all people.<br></p><p>Vivien Stern is a Senior Research Fellow at the International Centre for Prison Studies, King's College, London. <br>&#34;This book sparkles with hopeful ideas about how we could reduce crimeand the prison population. It shows how the worldwide move to privately owned prisons and the ideas that flow from marketed services are leading to increased fear of crime, costly prisons and cruel regimes. It outlines very clearly how we could do better.&#39; Clare Short, MP &#39;Recently, overcrowding and frequent use of incarceration started here in Japan.

Now in compact paperback!</p><p>Brian Lavery is probably the world's leading authority on the ship of the line. Apart from contributing numerous articles to magazines and journals, he is the author of the highly successful two-volume history of sailing battleships, <i>The Ship of The Line</i>.This engaging, lavishly illustrated history covers all things nautical, from dugout canoes to nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Naval historian Lavery emphasizes the evolution of maritime technology, delving into advances in naval architecture, navigation, rigging and propulsion, and spotlighting such storied specimens as the Greek trireme, the Viking longboat, the Spanish galleon and the World War I Dreadnought. He also explores the economic and world-historical impact of these advances in the fostering of long-distance trade, exploration, European imperial expansion and the growth of port cities.

This lavish collection with over 1,000 drawings is an insightful chronicle. (Philosophy/History)</p><p>Perched halfway between college humor magazines and <i>National Lampoon,</i> underground comics are an overlooked component of the history of humor in this country. At their best, they're also fun as hell to read--protopunk satire, so crazy, crass, and scatological that the stories nearly drip off the page. Mark James Estren's <i>History of Underground Comics</i> is an excellent survey of the art in the days before Crumb was a movie star and well-mannered alternative weeklies brought Matt Groening and Lynda Barry into every suburb. As such, I wouldn't buy it for the kids; after looking at the book, my mother remarked, "I don't remember them being so dirty." (Of course they were, but she was dirtier herself back then.) If you're a fan of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers, Trashman, Bobby London's Duck and Weevil--and you know if you are--buy this book.

I&#x2019;d even practiced it: holding my breath, holding even my thoughts still. It was the one thing I could do better than anyone else, but I guess it made me seem weird. I got tired of my family saying, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with Peter?&#x201d;</p><p>There was a lot wrong with me. But at that moment the most serious thing was the rattlesnake on my feet.</p><p>I&#x2019;d just run away from home for the first time. <i>Possibly the last time, too</i>, I thought, staring down at the ground, blinking slowly, as if I could close my eyes and make the snake vanish.</p><p>I stood as still as I could on the edge of a limestone cliff, the toes of my tennis shoes hanging off the hillside, my heartbeat thudding hard and fast at the base of my throat, my neck stiff, and my eyes on my shoes. On the diamondback rattler, gleaming brown and black and silver-gray, curled around both my feet, looped across the tops of my laces.</p><p>Its head was unmistakably wedge-shaped, and its tail was light brown, decorated with eight rattles. I&#x2019;d had time to count them; I&#x2019;d been standing there for at least fifteen minutes, trying not to move a single muscle.</p><p>My mouth had gone bone dry. I swallowed hard, and the snake&#x2019;s head, which had rested on the top of my left sneaker near my bare ankle, bobbed up, black tongue tasting the air.</p><p>I held my breath.</p><p>For a moment, I thought of kicking the snake off my feet, running for it. Then I realized it was completely wrapped around my ankles. If I tried to kick it, it would bite me for sure. So far, it was just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. smelling me, it seemed like. I remembered that from reading about snakes when I was little. They smelled with their tongues.</p><p>I hoped it liked what it smelled, because I remembered something else. Rattlesnakes could strike at twice the length of their bodies. So this one, if it wanted to, could bite somewhere close to my throat.</p><p>Boots. I should have worn boots. Or at least jeans, instead of my stupid gym shorts from sixth-grade PE.</p><p>Dark spots swam before my eyes. I had to breathe. I did so, slowly, trying as hard as I could not to make any sound at all, not to attract the snake&#x2019;s attention any more than I had.</p><p>The snake didn&#x2019;t strike, or move, just continued to lick the air. And then, a centimeter at a time, it laid down on my feet.</p><p>Like it was planning to take a nap.</p><p>I breathed slow and easy, or tried to, and wondered how long a snake&#x2019;s nap might take. How long was I going to be standing there, with a snake wrapped around my ankles, waiting to be bitten or to fall over?</p><p>Someone would come looking for me, I thought. I wasn&#x2019;t hiding or anything. They&#x2019;d find me. If someone came over the hill and ran in the same direction I had for twenty minutes or so.</p><p>Out here in the totally uninhabited countryside.</p><p>I almost laughed. That was never going to happen. I was stuck out here, with nothing to do but wait, nothing to feel but fear.</p><p>As I stood there, trying as hard as I could not to rock back and forth for balance, I felt my shoulders begin to relax. There was nothing I could do, right?</p><p>Nothing but be still. Or die.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t die. I didn&#x2019;t even get in trouble when I got home four hours later. Turns out, it&#x2019;s not running away when no one notices you&#x2019;re gone.</p><p>&#x201c;What did you do today, Peter?&#x201d; Dad asked, passing me the mashed potatoes at dinner. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t stay in your room again, did you, buddy? You know, some fresh air would do you good.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t answer for a minute. What could I tell him? &#x201c;Dad, I ran away and spent the afternoon trapped by a venomous snake&#x201d;? Maybe he&#x2019;d feel guilty. He&#x2019;d been the reason I&#x2019;d left, after all. Well, his drumming anyway.</p><p>Dad had lost his job and most of his hair in the past year, and he&#x2019;d decided to relive his youth or something by playing the drums. He was &#x201c;brushing up his chops&#x201d; to audition for a band in Austin, he said.</p><p>That afternoon, he&#x2019;d tried to get me to join in, handing me cowbells and triangles and nodding at me when I was supposed to bang on them. Father-and-son time.</p><p>I had told him the sounds gave me a headache.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t lying.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re so sensitive, Peter,&#x201d; Dad had said, disappointed in me, as usual. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to toughen up.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d only heard that a thousand times. But for some reason, that day the truth had hit me. I&#x2019;d never be tough enough for him.</p><p>I wondered if he&#x2019;d believe I was tougher than a rattlesnake. I glanced up. Nope. He was wearing his perpetual &#x201c;Why is my son such a weirdo?&#x201d; expression. So I just answered, &#x201c;I went walking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d; Mom perked up and looked away from her lap, where she&#x2019;d been typing something on her phone under the tablecloth. Probably trying to get on Facebook, even though it was practically impossible to get reception way out here. &#x201c;Where did you go? Did you meet anyone?&#x201d;</p><p>I thought of the snake and smiled a little. I didn&#x2019;t think that was what she meant.</p><p>My older sister, Laura, stopped spooning baby food into Carlie&#x2019;s mouth&#x2014;or mostly onto her shirt and bib, as Carlie was sort of a moving target&#x2014;and interrupted. &#x201c;Are you kidding? Of course he didn&#x2019;t see anyone. Come on, Mom. You moved us out to the butt end of nowhere. There aren&#x2019;t any people for, like, fifty miles around.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Laura, that negative attitude has to go,&#x201d; Mom argued. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have you know, there are two boys Peter&#x2019;s age who live at a house only a mile away. This is a great place for us. It doesn&#x2019;t take any longer for me to commute in to the office, since there&#x2019;s almost no traffic&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because no people,&#x201d; Laura interrupted, leaning back in her chair and angrily popping pieces of okra into her mouth. &#x201c;No civilization,&#x201d; she growled through a mouth full of okra guts.</p><p>&#x201c;No tattooed boyfriends,&#x201d; Dad added. &#x201c;No potheads.&#x201d; He winked at me. I tried not to smile. I was the only one who&#x2019;d heard, since Mom had started up again.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re hardly one to talk about being civilized, Laura Elizabeth Stone.&#x201d; Mom raised her eyebrows. &#x201c;Eating with your fingers? When you two go back to school this fall, I think you&#x2019;ll want to act a little nicer&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>That set Laura off again, on her favorite topic of having to attend a country high school where the biggest summer event was a rodeo, and 80 percent of the kids raised goats and steers for 4-H.</p><p>It was really different out here in the hill country, that was for sure. Different from our apartment in San Antonio, where we&#x2019;d lived for almost eleven years. We&#x2019;d only been in the new house for a week, but I could tell it wouldn&#x2019;t ever be home. There was nothing homey about it: a two-story, thirty-year-old wood-frame box with three different colors of vinyl siding and windows so loose they rattled in a stiff breeze.</p><p>I hated it. I think we all did. But we hadn&#x2019;t had much choice. Our old landlord had said that Dad&#x2019;s drums and guitars were driving away his other tenants. &#x201c;Driving them crazy,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d moaned the day he delivered the news that he wouldn&#x2019;t renew our lease.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t blame him. The noise of my family was unreal. The TV was on all the time, turned up loud enough to cover Carlie&#x2019;s constant tantrums and crying. My mom talked on the phone whenever she was home, or talked<i> at</i> the girls and me. When she didn&#x2019;t think we were listening to her&#x2014;which was pretty much always&#x2014;she just talked louder.</p><p>Like she was doing now, arguing with Laura. My head started to feel like something was squeezing it slowly, but hard. Carlie went from spitting food on her tray to crying. I picked at my meat loaf and thought of the valley I&#x2019;d found that day. Where I&#x2019;d met the snake.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t that far. Just across some fields of weeds, cacti, and a few scraggly trees and bushes that had more thorns than leaves. Then over the top of the hill behind that, past the fence made of railroad ties stacked diagonally on each other like enormous Lincoln Logs, and across the thin stretch of asphalt that was being retaken by grasses and wildflowers on both edges.</p><p>Just far enough away that I couldn&#x2019;t hear crying or yelling or drumming.</p><p>It had seemed like a dream. For the first time in years, I hadn&#x2019;t heard cars or trains, TVs or video games or people. Hadn&#x2019;t seen a roofline or even a plane in the sky.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been alone for the first time in my whole life, almost. I liked it.</p><p>No, I loved it. Out there, my heartbeat was as loud as anything in the world.</p><p>Carlie shrieked. My head was the only thing pounding now. Well, that and Carlie&#x2019;s feet on the bottom of the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, why couldn&#x2019;t we get a better house at least? One with high-speed Internet?&#x201d; Laura asked. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like living on Mars.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; Dad agreed around a mouthful of salad. &#x201c;That part&#x2019;s such a drag. Maybe we could get the cable company to hook us up&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re on one paycheck,&#x201d; Mom hissed. &#x201c;Mine. Did you forget?&#x201d;</p><p>Dad lifted his chin in my direction, like I was supposed to say something.</p><p>I knew better.</p><p>But he didn&#x2019;t. He rolled his eyes&#x2014;at Mom. &#x201c;Like you would let me for one minute. Nag, nag, nag.&#x201d;</p><p>I held still. Laura did, too. Even Carlie paused in her tantrum. Then the world exploded into noise as Mom and Dad went at it, throwing blame and insults at each other as fast as they could, like they each were trying to win some invisible food fight.</p><p>And they didn&#x2019;t care who got hit.</p><p>&#x201c;You chose this place without even consulting me, Maxine,&#x201d; Dad yelled. &#x201c;Just because I&#x2019;m out of a job doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m out of the family.&#x201d; His next word was a bullet. &#x201c;Yet.&#x201d;</p><p>Carlie was crying full-out now, and Laura picked her up, humming some lullaby but never taking her eyes off Mom and Dad. She looked as scared as I felt.</p><p>Was this it? Were they splitting up?</p><p>My parents had always fought a little, usually in their room at night, after they thought us kids were asleep. But since Dad had been laid off eleven months ago&#x2014;the same week Mom had gotten promoted to assistant manager at the bank&#x2014;the yelling had gotten lots worse.</p><p>&#x201c;You know we had to get away from the city, Joshua,&#x201d; Mom said, her voice low. &#x201c;You know why.&#x201d; I felt her eyes on me, their eyes.</p><p>Maybe it <i>was</i> Dad&#x2019;s fault we&#x2019;d been evicted. But it was my fault we&#x2019;d had to move out here, away from the city they&#x2019;d all loved. I knew that. Laura made sure to remind me every day.</p><p>Their stares burned into my skin.</p><p>&#x201c;May I be excused?&#x201d; My voice was a whisper. Too soft; no one heard.</p><p>The headache was getting worse, fast. It felt like something was splitting behind my right eye. Like my brain was under attack.</p><p>I held every bit as still as I had that afternoon, and I wished I was back at the rim of the valley.</p><p>And then, in my mind, I was.</p><p><i>My skin prickled. Like something was watching me. Something invisible and mysterious and vast. It seemed like the valley was waiting to see what I would do. I stayed motionless for longer than I ever had, wondering what was expected.</i></p><p><i>And then the valley took a breath.</i></p><p><i>Wind moved across the bowl, shifting trees and bushes like the land was a giant cat being petted. It moved fast, faster. It was almost here, almost to me.</i></p><p><i>Would the wind knock me over?</i></p><p><i>The hot air rushed around me, and the clatter of leaves sounded like excited whispers in my ears. Sounded almost like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hissing?</i></p><p>I smiled, remembering the rattler. I&#x2019;d been so still, when it slid across my feet it had probably thought I was a tree or a rock. Thought I belonged there.</p><p><i>I stood for hours, snake around my ankles, fear in my throat. The breeze rose back up, pushing strands of my hair past my ears.

Glubb, who spent much of his adult life among the Bedouin of Arabia, here describes the social milieu, personality, religious message, family life, battles, and far-reaching influence of the Prophet. In Glubb&#39;s accessible account of the life of Muhammad, written for the general reader, the author explains how the age in which Muhammad lived influenced him, and describes the impact his personality had on Islam. Glubb offers insight into the atmosphere, suffused with Jewish, Christian, and polytheist thought, in which the Prophet perceived his religious mission; his attitudes towards women and his relationships with his wives; and the battles he lead to insure the survival of his followers, confronting enemies at Bedr and Uhud and eventually capturing the key city of Mecca.</p><p>Sir John Glubb (1897-1986) spent thirty years in the Middle East and wrote many books on the Arab world, including <i>War in the Desert: An R.A.F. Frontier Campaign</i> and <i>A Short History of the Arab Peoples</i>.The only sound, comprehensive, and 'popular' work in English on the life, times, and people of the Prophet. (<i>Kirkus</i>)<br><br>The best popular life of the Prophet of Islam available in the English language. An extraordinary accomplishment. (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>)<br><br>Glubb's long acquaintance with the Arabs has enabled him to make sense out of obscure legends and to bring long-dead battles to life. His book stings like caravan dust and sweeps forward like a charge of Bedouin cavalry. (<i>Newsweek</i>)<br><br>Glubb has written a history that is as fascinating to read as it is immediately and permanently valuable. (<i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i>)</p><h2>A Variorum Commentary on the Poems of John Milton: Volume 5, Part 8 [Paradise Lost, Books 11-12]</h2><p>This volume surveys all important and influential line-by-line commentary published between 1667 and 1970 on the impressive conclusion to Paradise Lost in books 11-12. In these last two books, Milton has taken the account of biblical history known to all his contemporaries and rendered it fresh by having the archangel Michael relate it to Adam in ways only partly suggested by the original text. In a series of visions in book 11, Michael shows Adam the results of his disobedience, and by a narration in book 12 the promise and revelation of "the greater Man" promised at the epic's beginning (1.5). Adam and Eve move from repentant sorrow to invigorated hope, with the world before them and guided by Providence.<p>The biblical influences on these last two books would have been instantly recognizable to Milton's original audience, but the helpful notes in this volume identify biblical references and other theological matters for modern audiences. Similarly, Milton's classical references to Homer, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Seneca, and others are located and explained, along with Milton's use of patristic, medieval, and early modern authors as well as later authors' use of Milton.</p><p>This volume will challenge the longstanding idea that the last two books of Paradise Lost are in any way inferior to the rest of the epic or unrelated to it. Besides the helpful introduction that traces the arguments over the value of the last books, the commentary to books 11 and 12 also demonstrates how many important and influential arguments about the epic are tied into these books. Successfully synthesizing a huge mass of Milton scholarship, Lares presents complex ideas clearly and succinctly.</p><p>Begun by Columbia University Press in the early 1970s, A Variorum Commentary on the Poems of John Milton presented three volumes. Now under the auspices of Duquesne University Press, an award-winning volume was published in 2009 on Samson Agonistes and the first volume on Paradise Lost in 2011. This volume by Jameela Lares represents the continuation of the project, with future volumes planned on the remaining books of Paradise Lost and Milton's English prosody as well.</p></p><p>JAMEELA LARES is professor of English at the University of Southern Mississippi.

Lucky for her, there&#x2019;s a new kid staying in the cottage down the road: a city boy with a famous dad, Julian&#x2019;s more than a little full of himself, but he&#x2019;s also a storyteller like Avery. So when he announces his plan to film a ghost story, Avery is eager to join in.<br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately, Julian wants to film at Hilliard House, a looming, empty mansion that Grandma has absolutely forbidden her to enter. As terrified as Avery is of Grandma&#x2019;s wrath, the allure of filmmaking is impossible to resist.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the kids explore the secrets of Hilliard house, eerie things begin to happen, and the &#x201c;imaginary&#x201d; dangers in their movie threaten to become very real. Have Avery and Julian awakened a menacing presence? Can they turn back before they go too far?</p><p>Sonia Gensler is also the author of the young adult novels <i>The Dark Between</i> and <i>The Revenant</i>. She grew up in a small Tennessee town and spent her early adulthood collecting impractical degrees from various Midwestern universities. A former high school English teacher, she now writes full-time in Oklahoma.Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;Twelve-year-old Avery and her older brother, Blake, always spend summers on their grandmother's sprawling Tennessee farm. When Blake decides he is too old for Avery's favorite pretend game, Avery is furious and wounded. Then Avery meets a boy named Julian, an aspiring filmmaker. Julian is fascinated by a spooky old house on her grandmother's property&#x2014;a house that Avery's grandmother has forbidden her to enter. Yet Avery can't resist when Julian invites her to help with his latest project: filming a ghost story. The new friends encounter some bizarre, downright alarming phenomena in the old house, and Julian sees the location as a perfect cinematic opportunity. Avery begins to research the history of the house and her ancestors who lived there. She hates disobeying her grandmother, but the more research she does, the more certain she becomes that the truth about the house's reclusive last resident needs to be discovered. Gensler conveys Avery's "left behind younger sibling" feelings in an authentic, relatable way. She also gently addresses the frustrations of children in unconventional family situations, and the awkwardness of cultural/religious disagreements between parents and grandparents. Supernatural elements are "real," but not exaggerated to the point of being hokey. The true beauty here is the story's inspiration to budding journalists, historians, and genealogists. Readers are in for a good ghost story, but also for encouragement to learn more about their own local histories and family trees.VERDICT Ghostlight is well paced and suspenseful with a sensitive, endearing protagonist.&#x2014;Sara White, Seminole County Public Library, Casselberry, FL</p><h2>The Black Honeymoon</h2><p>A nurse accused of murder discovers that her new husband may have married her for ulterior motives and locks him out of her bedroom.

The egocentric and widely disliked leading man for the town's amateur theater group has slit his own throat with a "safe" prop in front of a full house, including Barnaby and his daughter (Mrs. Barnaby is a member of the theater company). The inspector must sort out the killer from a very traditional cast of suspects: the play's director whose ego matches--if not surpasses--that of his dead star; the leading man's bitter ex-wife; his current wife, whose faithfulness is less than perfect; the young second lead, who nurtures serious ambitions for the "real theater"; and various crew members. Particularly well drawn are Nicholas, the young actor, Deirdre, the assistant stage manager--whose primary concern is her senile father--and a homosexual pair responsible for design and lighting. A most enjoyable read, right down to the classic gathering of all the suspects at which Barnaby reveals the killer and the motive. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.The Causton Amateur Dramatic Society's production of Amadeus provides ample grist for Graham's delightful rumor mill. Immersed in their roles, various idiosyncratic participants in the play amuse themselves with gossip, posturing, cruel jokes, and, finally, murder. Given an insider's advantage because of his wife's involvement, Detective Inspector Barnaby ( The Killings at Badger's Drift, LJ 1/88), witnesses the staged "murder" and thus gains a head start with his investigation. The British author achieves her purpose with a fine cutting edge--detailed, witty, and observant--that slides the action along well-oiled tracks.

Beagle) <p> </p><p>Once a culturally rich world, the planet Aka has been utterly transformed by technology. Records of the past have been destroyed, and citizens are strictly monitored. But an official observer from Earth named Sutty has learned of a group of outcasts who live in the wilderness. They still believe in the ancient ways and still practice its lost religion<b> </b>the Telling. Intrigued by their beliefs, Sutty joins them on a sacred pilgrimage into the mountains...and into the dangerous terrain of her own heart, mind, and soul. </p><p></p></p><p>Earthling Sutty has been living a solitary, well-protected life in Dovza City on the planet Aka as an official Observer for the interstellar Ekumen. Insisting on all citizens being pure "producer-consumers," the tightly controlled capitalist government of Aka--the Corporation--is systematically destroying all vestiges of the ancient ways: "The Time of Cleansing" is the chilling term used to describe this era. Books are burned, the old language and calligraphy are outlawed, and those caught trying to keep any part of the past alive are punished and then reeducated. Frustrated in her attempts to study the linguistics and literature of Aka's cultural past, Sutty is sent upriver to the backwoods town of Okzat-Ozkat. Here she is slowly charmed by the old-world mountain people, whose still waters, she gradually realizes, run very deep. But whether their ways constitute a religion, ancient traditions, philosophy, or passive, political resistance, Sutty is not sure. Delving ever deeper into her hosts' culture, Sutty finds herself on a parallel spiritual quest, as well.<p> With quiet linguistic humor (Dovza citizens are passionate about their hot bitter beverage, <i>akakafi</i>--the ubiquitous Corporation brand is called Starbrew), dark references to the dangers of restricted cultural, political, and social freedom, and beautifully visualized worlds, award-winning author Ursula K.

After giving a brief, dry history of the museum, curator emeritus Holm (Northwest Coast Indian Art) offers concise descriptions of 100 objects, which are beautifully photographed in color. In clear, thoughtful prose, Holm explains how various tribes in the region transformed the stuff of everyday life and religious ritual into art. Although his text is occasionally repetitious, he succeeds in blending information on the artistic merit, historic value and cultural or practical role of the various objects, which range from an elegant canoe bailer of red cedar to a ferocious helmet that may have been worn by Tlingit warriors who captured and destroyed the Russian fort Archangel Michael in 1802. The book also includes fascinating archival photographs of Native Americans costumed in some of the regalia now in the museum, such as a frighteningly realistic grizzly bear mask. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.The Burke Museum of the University of Washington celebrates its Centennial with this catalog of 100 representative pieces from its collection of Northwest Coast Indian art. The masks, clothing, and ceremonial objects selected by Holm, affiliate of the museum for 50 years, are photographed documentary style: no camera nuances, just powerful designs. Brief descriptions give historical and cultural identity to each piece, though the metric measurements are an annoyance. Spare text and black-and-white photographs, nicely woven in, give the museum's chronology. Highly recommended for libraries in northwest America and British Columbia and for strong Native American collections.

Born Janet Miriam Holland Taylor Caldwell in Manchester, England, she moved with her family to Buffalo, New York, in 1907. She started writing stories when she was eight years old and completed her first novel when she was twelve. Married at age eighteen, Caldwell worked as a stenographer and court reporter to help support her family and took college courses at night, earning a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Buffalo in 1931. She adopted the pen name Taylor Caldwell because legendary editor Maxwell Perkins thought her debut novel, <i>Dynasty of Death </i>(1938), would be better received if readers assumed it were written by a man. In a career that spanned five decades, Caldwell published forty novels, many of which were <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers. Her best-known works include the historical sagas <i>The Sound of Thunder </i>(1957), <i>Testimony of Two Men </i>(1968), <i>Captains and the Kings </i>(1972), and <i>Ceremony of the Innocent </i>(1976), and the spiritually themed novels <i>The Listener </i>(1960) and <i>No One Hears But Him </i>(1966). <i>Dear and Glorious Physician </i>(1958), a portrayal of the life of St. Luke, and <i>Great Lion of God</i> (1970), about the life of St. Paul, are among the bestselling religious novels of all time. Caldwell&#x2019;s last novel, <i>Answer as a Man</i> (1981), hit the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller list before its official publication date. She died at her home in Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1985.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jess Stearn (1914&#x2013;2002) was a pioneer in the nonfiction field, treating with frankness the once-taboo subjects of homosexuality (<i>The Sixth Man</i>), and drugs (<i>The Seekers</i>). His book on yoga (<i>Yoga, Youth and Reincarnation</i>) helped to start a vogue in this country.

She was looking at containers full of documents that no one had touched in hundreds of years. </p><p>Mrs. Frazier, tall and majestic-looking, was gazing down her nose at Gemma and obviously waiting for her to say something. But how could Gemma put what she was feeling into words? How could she describe her lifetime fascination with history? Could she tell of the adventure of discovery that these documents represented to her? Or the excitement of the hunt to find new information, new&#x2014; </p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps it is all a bit overwhelming,&#x201d; Mrs. Frazier said as she flipped off the light switch, a sure sign that Gemma was to leave the precious boxes and their mysterious contents. Reluctantly, Gemma followed her into the cozy living room. Even the guesthouse that was to be used by whomever got the job was lovely. It had a large living room with a kitchen at one end, a big bedroom with a private bath, and the storage room they&#x2019;d just seen. At the front of the house was an extraordinarily beautiful and spacious office with double French doors that opened out onto acres of lawn and flowers. Outside, just beyond a covered carport, was a three-car garage that was filled floor to ceiling with many more boxes full of uncataloged documents. </p><p>Gemma&#x2019;s mind was reeling with the enormity of the task the job entailed. When her adviser for her doctorate in history e-mailed her that he&#x2019;d managed to get her an interview for a temporary job in the tiny town of Edilean, Virginia, Gemma had been pleased. But then he&#x2019;d explained that their university was the alma mater of a woman who wanted to hire someone to go through her family&#x2019;s papers and write a history. Gemma had scoffed at the idea. What did that mean? Great-granny and Ellis Island? Too, too boring. </p><p>Later that day she&#x2019;d stopped by his office to give him the courtesy of a personal reply. Gemma told him sorry, but now that her course work was done, she needed to work on her dissertation so she could finish her Ph.D. </p><p>&#x201c;I think you should look at this.&#x201d; Her adviser handed her a letter printed on expensive, heavy vellum. It said that Mrs. Peregrine Frazier had purchased from her husband&#x2019;s family&#x2019;s estate in England several hundred boxes full of documents that dated back to the sixteenth century. She was offering a job to someone to catalog them and write a history from what was found. </p><p>Gemma looked across the desk at her adviser. &#x201c;Sixteenth century&#x201d; and &#x201c;several hundred boxes&#x201d; weren&#x2019;t exactly the normal genealogy. &#x201c;Who else has seen these papers?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Rats, mice,&#x201d; her adviser said as he held up a fatly stuffed envelope. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all in here. The papers have been in the attic of a house in England since the place was built back around Elizabeth the First&#x2019;s time. The family&#x2014;&#x201d; He pulled a page from the envelope and glanced at it. &#x201c;They were the earls of Rypton. They sold the house about the time of the American Revolution, but a generation later the family managed to buy it back. Just recently the old place was sold again, but this time the house went to a corporation that wanted the attics cleared, so they held an auction.&#x201d; </p><p>Gemma sat down. Actually, she half collapsed onto the chair in front of the man&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;So this Mrs. Frazier . . .&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Went to England and bought every piece of paper that had been stored in the house over the centuries. It doesn&#x2019;t say exactly how much she paid for all of it, just that it was &#x2018;multithousands.&#x2019; Seems there was a bidding war at the auction, but Mrs. Frazier came away with everything. I get the impression that she&#x2019;s a rather formidable woman. If she wants it, she gets it.&#x201d; </p><p>Gemma looked at the letter she was holding. &#x201c;And no one knows what&#x2019;s in there?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No. The auction house hauled everything downstairs and divided it into lots. That they didn&#x2019;t open anything was part of what caused the bidding frenzy. For all anyone knows they could all be just household accounts and of little interest to anyone outside the family. How much beef the earl bought in 1742 would probably fascinate his descendants but no one else. Certainly not the Ph.D. committee.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;But then something of a more universal interest could be in there,&#x201d; he added with a smile. </p><p>Gemma was trying to digest this information. &#x201c;How long does this woman think it will take one person, with no staff, to go through these documents and piece together a family history?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s offering two years to start, and that includes free housing on her family&#x2019;s estate, the use of a car, and twenty-five grand a year salary. If it isn&#x2019;t done in two years . . .&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;I think the deal is that it&#x2019;ll take as long as it does. If I didn&#x2019;t have a wife and kids I&#x2019;d try for the job myself.&#x201d; </p><p>Gemma was still trying to grasp the facts. If this information was legitimate, she might be able to write her dissertation from something she found in this massive amount of data. As it was, she hadn&#x2019;t even come up with a subject to write about, much less begun her research. She looked back at her adviser. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the catch?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re up against some stiff competition.&#x201d; </p><p>From his hesitation, Gemma knew it wasn&#x2019;t going to be good news. &#x201c;Who?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Kirk Laurence and Isla Wilmont.&#x201d; </p><p>Gemma&#x2019;s face showed her surprise. The three of them were the same age and were all finishing their doctorates, but other than that, there was no resemblance between her and them. &#x201c;Why would either one of them want a job like this? A little town in Virginia, living in somebody&#x2019;s guesthouse? Years of researching? That doesn&#x2019;t sound like either of them.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I hear there are three grown sons. Unmarried. Rich.&#x201d; </p><p>Gemma groaned. &#x201c;That takes care of Isla, but what about Kirk?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;From what I understand, the trust fund his late father set up supports him as long as he&#x2019;s in school. All he has to do is charm Lady Frazier into hiring him, and he might be able to postpone graduation for years. I heard that if he can&#x2019;t get a job right after he finishes, he&#x2019;s expected to go into his family&#x2019;s business of making windows and doors.&#x201d; He looked at Gemma. &#x201c;These papers could be a good chance for publication.&#x201d; </p><p>Gemma drew in her breath. Publication&#x2014;the kind past a dissertation&#x2014;was what could make or break an academic&#x2019;s future career. Being published could mean that Kirk got out of having to go into the family business, and Isla might not be so desperate to marry someone who could support her. </p><p>When Gemma thought of the suave sophistication of Kirk and Isla, she could easily imagine their charming some small town woman. But even if Gemma didn&#x2019;t have a chance of winning over them, that wasn&#x2019;t going to keep her from trying. &#x201c;How did this Mrs. Frazier get my name?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Seems that the president of the university is an old friend of hers. A couple of months ago he asked everyone in the history department to send him some recommendations of students for the job. All of us sent a few, and Mrs. Frazier narrowed it down to three people she wanted to interview, and you&#x2019;re one of them. By the way, I wrote a glowing reference saying that you&#x2019;d do the best job that could be done.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m sure someone&#x2014;or probably half a dozen others&#x2014;wrote the same about Kirk and Isla.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No doubt they did,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The difference is that mine is true. You will go to the interview, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Of course. If nothing else, I&#x2019;d like to see the stash.&#x201d; Gemma opened the door to his office, then turned back to look at him. &#x201c;You realize, don&#x2019;t you, that if this Mrs. Frazier has an estate, that means country clubs with golf courses and dinners with three forks. Kirk and Isla are the kind of people she&#x2019;ll want living nearby, not Gemma Ranford who&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Who works harder in a week than those two butterflies do in a year.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Gemma said as she hoisted her heavy bag onto her shoulder. </p><p>He was glad she was going to try for the job. If anyone deserved a break, it was Gemma. He&#x2019;d never had a student who worked harder than she did. &#x201c;So where are you off to now?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Guess.&#x201d; </p><p>He grinned. &#x201c;Punching the boys?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You got it. I have to do something to make sure they learn.&#x201d; As she left his office, she tucked the envelope into her satchel. </p><p>That night Gemma closed her bedroom door, got into bed, and started going through the packet of papers that Mrs. Frazier had prepared. Gemma read about the auction in England, about the town of Edilean&#x2014;which was ten miles outside Williamsburg and William and Mary College&#x2014;and thought about all of it. At eleven one of her two roommates returned amid a cacophony of giggles and stumbles over the furniture. She and her latest boyfriend went into her bedroom, and other sounds soon started. </p><p>Gemma pulled the covers over her head and used her book light to continue with the papers. There were photos of the Frazier estate. It was a large house on twenty-five acres, with two guesthouses set amid the trees. The Fraziers owned four huge car dealerships in Virginia, and there was a brochure from the one in Richmond. <i>Biggest</i> was the w...</p></p><h2>Ghost Singer</h2><p><p>Human ears, strung like beads on a cord; scalps with hair and ears still intact; infant bones in a medicine bundle; corpses, whole, in a cardboard box.

The public remains generally unaware of the issue. That would be fine except that selfdeception is so pervasive it touches every aspect of life. Touches is perhaps too gentle a word to describe its influence. Selfdeception actually determines ones experience in every aspect of life. The extent to which it does that, and in particular the extent to which it is the central issue in personal and professional leadership, is the subject of this book. Leadership and SelfDeception, first published in the year 2000, became an international bestseller. Launched with no fanfare when Arbinger (and its work) was little known, the book generated tremendous wordofmouth momentum. Sales of the book continue to grow at an increasing rate even today, and the book continues to appear on bestseller lists around the world, many years after publication. The book is currently available in more than twenty languages.</p><p>Using the story/parable format so popular these days, <i>Leadership and Self-Deception</i> takes a novel psychological approach to leadership. It's not what you do that matters, say the authors (presumably plural--the book is credited to the esteemed Arbinger Institute), but why you do it. Latching onto the latest leadership trend won't make people follow you if your motives are selfish--people can smell a rat, even one that says it's trying to empower them. The tricky thing is, we don't know that our motivation is flawed. We deceive ourselves in subtle ways into thinking that we're doing the right thing for the right reason. We really do know what the right thing to do is, but this constant self-justification becomes such an ingrained habit that it's hard to break free of it--it's as though we're trapped in a box, the authors say. <p> Learning how the process of self-deception works--and how to avoid it and stay in touch with our innate sense of what's right--is at the heart of the book. We follow Tom, an old-school, by-the-book kind of guy who is a newly hired executive at Zagrum Corporation, as two senior executives show him the many ways he's "in the box," how that limits him as a leader in ways he's not aware of, and of course how to get out. This is as much a book about personal transformation as it is about leadership per se. The authors use examples from the characters' private as well as professional lives to show how self-deception skews our view of ourselves and the world and ruins our interactions with people, despite what we sincerely believe are our best intentions. </p><p> While the writing won't make John Updike lose any sleep, the story entertainingly does the job of pulling the reader in and making a potentially abstruse argument quite enjoyable. The authors have a much better ear for dialogue than is typical of the genre (the book is largely dialogue), although a certain didactic tone creeps in now and then. But ultimately it's a hopeful, even inspiring read that flows along nicely and conveys a message that more than a few managers need to hear. --<i>Pat McGill</i></p>"Arbinger" is the ancient French spelling of the word "harbinger." It means "one that indicates or foreshadows what is to come; a forerunner." The Arbinger Institute is a forerunner, a "harbinger," of change. <p>Arbinger's change work grows out of the development at the heart of the human sciences that is introduced in this book. Led by philosopher Terry Warner, a team of scholars has broken new ground in solving the age-old problem of self-deception. The result is a striking account of human behavior and human potential. The Arbinger Institute was founded to translate this important work into practical effect for individuals, families, and organizations worldwide. </p><p>Arbinger's focus on organizations began when a well-known consultant asked for our help with one of his clients. As a result of Arbinger's work, that company became the industry's profit leader, eventually doubling and even tripling the return on investment of its nearest competitors. Out of that experience Arbinger began to focus on the organizational implications and applications of the self-deception problem and solution--a focus that continues today. </p><p>Founded by Terry Warner, Arbinger is led by managing directors Duane Boyce, Jim Ferrell, and Paul Smith.

Equal to men in battle, legends claimed they cut off their right breasts to improve their archery skills and routinely killed their male children to purify their ranks.</p><p>For centuries people believed in their existence and attempted to trace their origins.

Sacks relates whole cases, such as "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat," laying out the brain physiology and the panoply of behavioral distortions involved in neurological abnormality. Broks, a psychologist rather than a physician like Sacks, uses cases as jumping-off points for essays in search of personality, unique consciousness, the soul. He believes there is something in the brain that neuroscience may never find or explain, and that gives each of us the sense of self. Moreover, he posits that dualism is inescapable for consciousness, which demands that each of us discriminate between physical and mental "parts" of the self, despite the inseparability of those parts. While he has readers chewing those insoluble nuggets, he tells his patients' and his own riveting stories, at least one of which, "To be two or not to be," is science fiction of the very highest order. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Far from the actions of the Continental Congress and the Continental Army, they took responsibility for the course of the revolution. They policed their neighbors, sent troops and weapons to distant strangers committed to the same cause, and identified friends and traitors. By taking up the reins of power but also setting its limits, they ensured America&#x2019;s success. Without their participation there would have been no victory over Great Britain, no independence. The colonial rebellion would have ended like so many others&#x2015;in failure.</p><p>The driving force behind the creation of a country based on the will of the people, T. H. Breen shows, was in fact the people itself. In villages, towns, and cities from Georgia to New Hampshire, Americans managed local affairs, negotiated shared sacrifice, and participated in a political system in which each believed they were as good as any other. Presenting hundreds of stories, Breen captures the powerful sense of equality and responsibility resulting from this process of self-determination.</p><p>With striking originality, Breen restores these missing Americans to our founding and shows why doing so is essential for understanding why our revolution ended differently from others that have shaped the modern world. In the midst of revolution&#x2019;s anger, fear, and passion&#x2015;the forgotten elements in any effective resistance&#x2015;these Americans preserved a political culture based on the rule of law. In the experiences of these unsung revolutionaries can be seen the creation of America&#x2019;s singular political identity.</p></p><p>T. H. Breen is John Kluge Professor of American Law and Governance at the Library of Congress and Founding Director of the Chabraja Center for Historical Studies at Northwestern University. A former Guggenheim Fellow, he has taught American history at Oxford, Cambridge, and Yale universities and is James Marsh Professor-at-Large at the University of Vermont. He is the author of many books, including <i>George Washington&#x2019;s Journey</i>, winner of the History Prize of the Society of the Cincinnati and finalist for the George Washington Book Prize; and <i>Marketplace of Revolution</i>, winner of the Society of Colonial Wars Book Award. He is a frequent contributor to the <i>New York Review of Books</i> and <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>.&#x201c;The American Revolution involved not simply the wisdom of a few great men but, more important, the passions, fears, and religiosity of ordinary people. This is the sensible point of this important and lucidly written book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Gordon S. Wood, author of <i>Friends Divided: John Adams and Thomas Jefferson</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Is it possible to have popular government without popular excess? In asking that very timely question, Breen ingeniously demonstrates what the un-excessive American Revolution was able to accomplish&#x2015;and what it was unable to complete. Revolutions continue today; today&#x2019;s revolutionaries would learn a great deal from this masterful study.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joyce E. Chaplin, Harvard University</b><br><br>&#x201c;A provocative and timely contribution to our understanding of the American Revolution. Breen shows us a nation-making war that channeled political passions in surprisingly constructive, stabilizing ways. <i>The Will of the People</i> deserves the widest possible audience.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter S. Onuf, University of Virginia</b><br><br>&#x201c;The American Revolution was made not just on the battlefields, in the halls of power, or in the minds of intellectuals, T. H. Breen argues in this elegant and persuasive work. Communities of ordinary men and women&#x2015;farmers, workers, and artisans who kept the revolutionary faith until victory over the British forces was achieved&#x2015;were essential to the effort. <i>The Will of the People</i> deftly brings their perspectives and contributions into full view.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Annette Gordon-Reed, Harvard University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Ordinary people, Breen reminds us, were the Revolution&#x2019;s true heroes. These men and women made America&#x2019;s birth possible, and this marvelous book reminds us that it is their example that keeps the Revolution alive today.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eliga Gould, author of <i>Among the Powers of the Earth: The American Revolution and the Making of a New World Empire</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Breen has written a study of the American Revolution unlike any other. He recovers the lost world of revolutionaries, allowing readers to witness one of history&#x2019;s most momentous events, ordinary Americans, animated by hope and fear, founding a nation. This is a book crafted by a master historian writing at the top of his game.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Patrick Griffin, University of Notre Dame</b><br><br>&#x201c;There is no single story of the American Revolution, Breen argues crisply and persuasively. While not dismissing the essential contributions of the Founders, he insists we cannot fully understand how the revolution succeeded until we are also attentive to the emotional discourse of ordinary people from small communities and port towns from which a lasting political culture took shape.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Barbara Oberg, Editor Emeritus, Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Princeton University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Looks closely at the struggle for American independence and asks what made the American revolutionary experience so different.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William Anthony Hay</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An examination of the effects of the American Revolution on ordinary people, with some anxious glances at our political divisions today...Breen wonders if, in our current era, we will be able to employ the essential lessons about unity that he has extracted from the past...Enlightening, revolutionary thinking.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Tells a new story about the American Revolution, one mostly left in the deep shade of the Founding Fathers&#x2019; towering shadows. Eschewing the standard histories of the Revolution that place primary importance upon its political theories and legal reasoning, Breen revises this overdone focus to highlight the &#x2018;true sites of resistance&#x2019;&#x2015;the small communities across the fledgling nation who daily sustained the fight for independence...Extremely well-paced and engaging.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peggy Kurkowski</b><b>, </b><b><i>Open Letters Review</i></b></p><h2>Dark Angel</h2><p>This is the exciting coming-of-age story of an 11-12 year old girl in the years soon after the Civil War. She&#39;s all tomboy and wonder -- wonder about becoming a woman, as her older sister is already. She is the colorfully outspoken daughter of a Mormon Bishop in 1869 Utah Territory. Everything around her cannot escape her critical eye and mouth. She is a typical child, girl or boy, at the brink of adulthood. Her life is changed forever when a stranger, a man no one seems to know, saves her and her older sister from the unwanted attentions of several lecherous army deserters (and Mormon haters) by killing them before too much harm comes to the girls. This novel is rough and fast and funny as only Robert Kirby can write it. This is a book about Mormons, by a Mormon, but not exclusively for Mormons. If it was a movie it would be rated PG or a soft PG-13 due to some language and a situation or two. A great read! 15 out of 17 Amazon readers agree! You will too!</p><p></p><h2>Lady Killer (87th Precinct Mystery)</h2><p>The detectives at the 87th Precinct have twelve hours to find out to whom the mysterious crank letter writer was referring when he wrote &#34;I will kill the lady tonight at 8. What can you do about it.&#34; Reissue.</p><p><strong>Stephen King and Nelson DeMille on Ed McBain</strong><br><br> I think Evan Hunter, known by that name or as Ed McBain, was one of the most influential writers of the postwar generation. He was the first writer to successfully merge realism with genre fiction, and by so doing I think he may actually have created the kind of popular fiction that drove the best-seller lists and lit up the American imagination in the years 1960 to 2000. Books as disparate as <em>The New Centurions</em>, <em>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</em>, <em>The Godfather</em>, <em>Black Sunday</em>, and <em>The Shining</em> all owe a debt to Evan Hunter, who taught a whole generation of baby boomers how to write stories that were not only entertaining but that truthfully reflected the times and the culture. He will be remembered for bringing the so-called "police procedural" into the modern age, but he did so much more than that. And he was one hell of a nice man. --<em>Stephen King<br><br></em>Way back in the mid-1970s, when I was a new writer and police series were very big, my editor asked me to do a series called <em>Joe Ryker, NYPD.</em> I had no idea how to write a police detective novel, but the editor handed me a stack of books and said, &#x201c;These are the 87th Precinct novels by Ed McBain. Read them and you&#x2019;ll know everything you need to know about police novels.&#x201d; After I read the first book--which I think was <em>Let&#x2019;s Hear It for the Deaf Man</em>--I was hooked, and I read every Ed McBain I could get my hands on. Then I sat down and wrote my own detective novel, <em>The Sniper</em>, featuring Joe Ryker. My series never reached the heights of the 87th Precinct series, but by reading those classic masterpieces, I learned all I needed to know about urban crime and how detectives think and act. And I had a hell of a time learning from the master. Years later, when I actually got to meet Ed McBain/Evan Hunter, I told him this story, and he said, &#x201c;I would have liked it better if my books inspired you to become a detective instead of becoming my competition.&#x201d; Evan and I became friends, and I was privileged to know him and honored to be in his company. I remain indebted to him for his good advice over the years. But most of all, I thank him for hundreds of hours of great reading. --<em>Nelson DeMille</em> <p>To read about how Ed McBain influenced other mystery and thriller writers, visit our Perspectives on McBain page.</p> <p>For a complete selection of 87th Precinct novels available from Thomas &amp; Mercer, visit our Ed McBain's 87th Precinct Booklist.</p>Ed McBain&#39;s real name is Evan Hunter and he has written best-selling books under this name.

English-speaking readers tend to think of this army in terms of the North African campaign; but far more Italian troops served in other theatres. They invaded, and later bore the major burden of occupying, the Balkan countries; and Italy sent 250,000 troops to fight on the Russian Front. In this, the first of a three-part study, Philip Jowett covers the European theatre - including Russia - from 1940 to Italy's armistice with the Allies in 1943. Many interesting uniforms, a number of them new to most readers, are meticulously illustrated by Stephen Andrew.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.Philip Jowett is a &#39;small wars&#39; enthusiast who has developed a reputation for primary source research and previously unseen material. His first book for Osprey MAA 306 Chinese Civil War Armies 1911-49 received excellent reviews for precisely these qualities. Having moved on to cover &#39;bigger&#39; conflicts, Philip has maintained the quality of his research and information.</p><h2>We Are Painting (High-Frequency Readers, Book 9)</h2><p>Book 9 of the <i>High-Frequency Readers</i> series introduces two new words - ARE and WE - in a simple, short story that also highlights colors.</p><p></p><h2>Under a Lucky Star</h2><p><i>Under a Lucky Star </i>is the autobiography&#x2014;the lifetime of adventure&#x2014;of the explorer and archaeologist Roy Chapman Andrews. Adored by the public and pursued by the press, Andrews came as close to superstar status in the 1920s as any explorer of the twentieth century. Much of <i>Under a Lucky Star</i> focuses on his grandest adventure, the Central Asiatic Expeditions, a series of five daring journeys into uncharted expanses of the Gobi Desert that produced a previously unknown treasure-trove of dinosaur remains. The Gobi region explored by Andrews and his team of scientists proved to be one of the most fruitful sites on earth for late dinosaurs and it continues to yield extraordinary paleontological discoveries.</p><p>Roy Chapman Andrews (1884&#x2013;1960) became fascinated with the natural world during his childhood along the Rock River in Wisconsin. After attending Beloit College, Andrews traveled to New York and asked for a job at the American Museum of Natural History, where he started as a janitor and eventually became the director of the museum.&#x201c;Organized under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History and heavily financed by Wall Street titans and public donations, the Central Asiatic Expeditions were immense in scope and logistical complexity. . . . Andrews and his companions challenged the Gobi using automobiles supported by camel caravans, an audacious concept denounced by many skeptics as foolhardy if not impossible. . . . In retrospect, the Central Asiatic Explorations constituted one of the truly innovative episodes in the annals of scientific discovery.&#x201d;&#x2014;from the foreword by Charles Gallenkamp, archaeologist and co-author of <i>Dragon Hunter: Roy Chapman Andrews and the Central Asiatic Expeditions</i><i><br><br></i>"From the time that I can remember anything, I always intended to be an explorer, to work in a natural history museum, and to live out of doors. Actually, I never had any choice of a profession. I wanted to be an explorer and naturalist so passionately that anything else as a life work just never entered my mind."&#x2014;Roy Chapman Andrews, <i>Under a Lucky Star </i><br><i><br></i>&#x201c;Hollywood added an unlikely boost to [Roy Chapman Andrews&#x2019;s] reviving fame with the creation of the daring celluloid explorer &#x2018;Indiana Jones.&#x2019; Persistent rumors credit Andrews with serving as the real-life model for the adventurous lifestyle of the imaginary explorer Dr. Henry Jones, Jr. (The gun-toting, fedora-wearing Andrews hated snakes, too.)&#x201d;&#x2014;from the afterword by Ann Bausum, author of <i>Dragon Bones and Din</i><i>osaur Eggs: A Photobiography of Explorer Roy Chapman Andrews</i><i></i></p><h2>Black Wind</h2><p><br><br><p>F.

The third installment in the series is the most impressive so far, and Prima's guide to the game should help players battle their way to supremacy in Erathia. As the name suggests, heroes are key to success, and the book begins with a rundown of the different types of heroes and their abilities. Magic is also discussed in detail (being one of the major abilities available to heroes) and the fine art of town building is also explained. Each of the many creatures in the game is described in table form (though the images are too small to do the in-game artwork justice) and a lengthy section on combat can help you figure out how best to employ the creatures under your control. Following a brief chapter on general game strategies, you'll find a breakdown of each scenario in the game. The book does not provide step-by-step walkthroughs for these scenarios, but then again this is not the sort of game that lends itself to walkthroughs. Instead, you'll get an overview of each situation and some tips for emerging victorious. The book closes with an extensive (but difficult to read, due to the tiny type) table on magic items and artifacts.You are Erathia&#39;s only hope.</p><h2>A Caribbean Mystery</h2><p>[Read by Emilia Fox]<br><br>As Miss Marple sat basking in the Caribbean sunshine, her interest was aroused by an old soldiers yarn about a murderer he had knowna dangerous diversion.</p><p>As Jane Marple sat basking in the tropical sunshine she felt mildly discontented with life.

Divided by format (e.g., "Illumination," "Bindings," "Documentary Manuscripts," "Poetry and Experimental Typography"), each section offers about 10 examples in the form of full-page color plates, each faced by detailed discussion of the technology, purpose, and practitioner who yielded the reproduced work. Budding as well as accomplished artists will cherish this history of illustration; readers who have no artistic talents will, nonetheless, better understand how books have evolved as aspects of material culture. The text is technical but accessible and the amount of information about the role of print material in Western culture is elucidating. The reproduction quality is excellent, making this a feast for the eye as well as the mind.

Amidst the scientific fervor of the Revolution two French scientists, Delambre and Mechain, were sent out on an expedition to measure the shape of the world and thereby establish the metre (which was to be one ten-millionth the distance from pole to equator). Their hope was that people would use the globe as the basis of measure rather than an arbitrary system meted out by the monarchs. As one scientist went north along the French meridian and the other south, their experiences diverged just as radically. After seven years, they received a hero&#39;s welcome upon their return to Paris. Mechain, however, was obsessed over a minute error in his calculations that he&#39;d discovered and concealed, and which eventually drove him to his grave. His death forced his colleague Delambre to choose between loyalty to his friend and his science.</p><p>Ken Alder has a PhD from Harvard in History of Science as well as a Physics degree. In 1998 he won the Dexter Prize for the best book on the history of technology.<b>Prologue</b><p>In June 1792 -- in the dying days of the French monarchy, as the world began to revolve around a new promise of Revolutionary equality -- two astronomers set out in opposite directions on an extraordinary quest. The erudite and cosmopolitan Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Delambre made his way north from Paris, while the cautious and scrupulous Pierre-Franï¿½ois-Andrï¿½ Mï¿½chain made his way south. Each man left the capital in a customized carriage stocked with the most advanced scientific instruments of the day and accompanied by a skilled assistant. Their mission was to measure the world, or at least that piece of the meridian arc which ran from Dunkerque through Paris to Barcelona. Their hope was that all the world's peoples would henceforth use the globe as their common standard of measure. Their task was to establish this new measure -- "the meter" -- as one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the equator.</p><p>The meter would be eternal because it had been taken from the earth, which was itself eternal. And the meter would belong equally to all the people of the world, just as the earth belonged equally to them all. In the words of their Revolutionary colleague Condorcet -- the founder of mathematical social science and history's great optimist -- the metric system was to be "for all people, for all time."</p><p>We often hear that science is a revolutionary force that imposes radical new ideas on human history. But science also emerges from within human history, reshaping ordinary actions, some so habitual we hardly notice them. Measurement is one of our most ordinary actions. We speak its language whenever we exchange precise information or trade objects with exactitude. This very ubiquity, however, makes measurement invisible. To do their job, standards must operate as a set of shared assumptions, the unexamined background against which we strike agreements and make distinctions. So it is not surprising that we take measurement for granted and consider it banal. Yet the use a society makes of its measures expresses its sense of fair dealing. That is why the balance scale is a widespread symbol of justice. The admonition is found in the Old Testament: "Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. Just balances, just weights, a just <i>ephah,</i> and a just <i>hin,</i> shall ye have." Our methods of measurement define who we are and what we value.</p><p>The men who created the metric system understood this. They were the preeminent scientific thinkers of the Enlightenment, an age which had elevated reason to the rank of "sole despot of the universe." These savants -- as the investigators who studied nature were known in those days -- had a modern face looking toward our own times, and an older face glancing back toward the past. In their own minds, of course, they were not two-faced; it was their world which was two-faced, with its burdensome past obstructing progress and a utopian future waiting to be born.</p><p>The savants were appalled by the diversity of weights and measures they saw all around them. Measures in the eighteenth century not only differed from nation to nation, but within nations as well. This diversity obstructed communication and commerce, and hindered the rational administration of the state. It also made it difficult for the savants to compare their results with those of their colleagues. One Englishman, traveling through France on the eve of the Revolution, found the diversity there a torment. "[I]n France," he complained, "the infinite perplexity of the measures exceeds all comprehension. They differ not only in every province, but in every district and almost every town...." Contemporaries estimated that under the cover of some eight hundred names, the Ancien Rï¿½gime of France employed a staggering 250,000 different units of weights and measures.</p><p>In place of this Babel of measurement, the savants imagined a universal language of measures that would bring order and reason to the exchange of both goods and information. It would be a rational and coherent system that would induce its users to think about the world in a rational and coherent way. But all the savants' grand plans would have remained fantasy had not the French Revolution -- history's great utopian rupture -- provided them with an unexpected chance to throw off the shackles of custom and build a new world upon principled foundations. Just as the French Revolution had proclaimed universal rights for all people, the savants argued, so too should it proclaim universal measures. And to ensure that their creation would not be seen as the handiwork of any single group or nation, they decided to derive its fundamental unit from the measure of the world itself.</p><p>For seven years Delambre and Mï¿½chain traveled the meridian to extract this single number from the curved surface of our planet. They began their journey in opposite directions, and then, when they had reached the extremities of their arc, measured their way back toward one another through a country quickened with revolution. Their mission took them to the tops of filigree cathedral spires, to the summits of domed volcanoes, and very nearly to the guillotine. It was an operation of exquisite precision for such violent times. At every turn they encountered suspicion and obstruction. How do you measure the earth while the world is turning beneath your feet? How do you establish a new order when the countryside is in chaos? How do you set standards at a time when everything is up for grabs? Or is there, in fact, no better time to do so?</p><p>At last, their seven years of travel done, the two astronomers converged on the southern fortress town of Carcassonne, and from there returned to Paris to present their data to an International Commission, the world's first international scientific conference. The results of their labors were then enshrined in a meter bar of pure platinum. It was a moment of triumph: proof that in the midst of social and political upheaval, science could produce something of permanence. Accepting the fruit of their labor, France's new supreme ruler made a prophesy. "Conquests will come and go," Napoleon Bonaparte declared, "but this work will endure."</p><p>In the last two hundred years, conquests have indeed come and gone, but the meter has become the measure of all things. The metric system serves today as the common language of high-tech communications, cutting-edge science, machine production, and international commerce. Older forms of measurement have receded as the metric system has made possible trade and economic coordination on a fully global scale. Paradoxically, the leading nation in the global economy remains the sole exception to this rule. Thomas Jefferson failed to convince Congress to make the United States the second nation to adopt the metric system, and every reformer since has met the same fate. John Quincy Adams, asked to consider whether the United States should adhere to the metric system, called it the greatest invention since the printing press and predicted it would save more human labor than the steam engine. Yet he recommended against its adoption. Only in recent years have American manufacturers begun retooling for metric units. Few Americans realize that a silent revolution is finally underway in their nation, transforming their measures under the pressures of the new global economy.</p><p>As things stand, of course, this conversion is embarrassingly incomplete. Americans became painfully aware of this fact in 1999 with the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter. A NASA investigation into the satellite's failure revealed that one team of engineers had used traditional American units, while another had used metric units. The result was a trajectory error of sixty miles, and a $125-million disappearing act.</p><p>The Revolutionary scientists created the metric system two hundred years ago to avoid just this sort of fiasco. One of their aims was to facilitate communication among scientists, engineers, and administrators. Their grander ambition was to transform France -- and ultimately, the whole world -- into a free market for the open exchange of goods and information. Today, their goal seems within reach. Over 95 percent of the world's population now officially uses the metric system, and its success is touted as one of the benign triumphs of globalization.</p><p>But behind the public triumph of the metric system lies a long and bitter history. The fundamental fallacy of utopianism is to assume that everyone wants to live in the same utopia. France, it turns out, was not only the first nation to invent the metric system; she was also the first to reject it. For decades after its introduction ordinary people spurned the new system, and clung to their local measures and the local economies they sustained. In the face of this revolt from below, Napoleon, on the eve of his disastrous invasion of Russia, returned France to the Paris measures of the Ancien Rï¿½gime. Now he mocked the global aspirations of the men he had once admired. "It was not enough for them to make forty million people happy," he sneered, "they wanted to sign up the whole universe." Not until the middle of the nineteenth century did France revert to the metric system, and even then use of the old measures persisted into the twentieth. It would take enormous scientific effort and years of bitter conflict to make metric measurement banal, just as it had taken a Revolution to bring the metric system into being. Things might easily have turned out differently.</p><p>What neither advocates nor opponents of the metric system could have known is that a secret error lies at the heart of the metric system -- an error perpetuated in every subsequent definition of the meter. Indeed, as I discovered in the course of my research, the only people who could have known the full extent of this error were Delambre and Mï¿½chain themselves.</p><p>For those who wish to know the origins of the metric system, there is one place to turn: the official account composed by one of the leaders of the meridian expedition, the north-going astronomer, Jean-Bap...</p></p><h2>The Disappearance (W.I.T.C.H.

Kennedy changed the course of history. Since that time a continuing debate has raged over who fired the fatal shots and whether a conspiracy existed involving a number of people plotting to kill the President. Among the hundreds of people who waited in Dealy Plaza for the motorcade to pass, only one person was able to identify Lee Harvey Oswald as the lone gunman firing from the Texas School Book Depository. Howard Brenna was seated directly in front of the building and was able to get a clear view of the assassin as he fired at the President&#x2019;s car. Mr. Brennan testified before the Warren Commission that he was able to see clearly the gunman who ended the life of President Kennedy. For over twenty years Howard kept the true account of the fateful day to himself. Other than the Warren Commission, and a bried statement on CBS television network, he refused all other interviews.

The work contains an alphabetical index, consisting mostly of individuals' names, and entries have <i>see</i> and <i>see also</i> references. As noted in our review for the previous edition, though the author claims to record the "living language of the day," he is still often behind the times. For instance, although <i>Axis of evil</i> has been added, other new entries in this edition include the already widely used term <i>make love</i> and the line <i>Make him an offer he can't refuse</i> from <i>The Godfather</i>.

The story opens with young Patti Brandon's life revolving around her farm, family, friends, and softball. Things are interrupted by the heavy rains and it soon becomes apparent that everyone will have to pitch in to keep the Mississippi River from ruining the fields. Patti is shown calling for help over her ham radio. She joins her neighbors as they stack sandbags at the water's edge. She gets her pet goat out of harm's way. She calls for a helicopter to come and save a man caught in the river. Although everyone works hard, the flood does much damage. When the water subsides and Patti returns to her bed, she discovers fish and worms under her blankets. Weeks later, her life has returned to normal, and she has a new respect for the mighty river. This realistic story is softened by the finely drawn pastel illustrations. The text is formatted like poetry, but the words are pure prose. An appended fact sheet reveals the damage of the flood-around $17 billion. Although this is classified as nonfiction, there is no indication of whether Patti is a real person. Still, the story pairs up nicely with Bruce Hiscock's The Big Rivers (Atheneum, 1997), which is also about the flood of 1993. Pfeffer capably shows how disasters can sometimes bring out the community spirit in people.<p></p><p><i>Anne Chapman Callaghan, Racine Public Library, WI</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Ages 5-8. The "Big Flood" of 1993 is the subject of this story describing one community's efforts to fight back the rising Mississippi River and save its farms. Patti's family runs a soybean farm on the banks of the swollen river. When Grandpa says in a worried tone, "Every farm along this river could be flooded," Patti's dad asks her to get on her ham radio and call for help. Lubach's nicely rendered realistic illustrations, all double-page spreads, show the neighbors in action, some stacking sandbags and working the pumps, others busily preparing food for the hungry workers. The story has a happy ending--the workers successfully hold back the waters until the rain ends--but an endnote describes a much different reality for thousands of people who live along the Mississippi. Use this in conjunction with a unit on weather or natural disasters or with Mary Calhoun's <i>Flood </i>(1997) for another view of the disaster. <i>Lauren Peterson</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

This is no mere 'baseball memorabilia.' It is baseball's heritage."<p>-Peter Golenbock Last September, Sotheby's held an auction of the greatest private collection of baseball memorabilia ever assembled-the Barry Halper Collection. With most of the nearly 2,500 items selling above the high estimate-including the 1920 signed agreement selling Babe Ruth from the Boston Red Sox to the New York Yankees ($189,500), the only signed Ty Cobb jersey ($332,500), and Mickey Mantle's glove (purchased by Billy Crystal for $239,000)-the sale earned a record-breaking $21.8 million. This spring, in time for baseball season, Abrams is proud to offer Sotheby's elegant, slipcased three-volume catalogue of the Barry Halper Collection at a special low price. Originally sold by Sotheby's for $80.00, this deluxe set includes more than 1,500 color photographs of the finest, rarest mementos from every era of baseball, each individually described, a wealth of anecdotes and historical information, and the final auction price list. This is the ultimate dream book for any baseball fan. Three volumes, slipcased. 1,623 illustrations, 1,573 in full color, separate price list, 8 x 10 5/8" PETER GOLENBOCK is a best-selling sportswriter whose books include Dynasty: The New York Yankees 1949-1964 and Wrigleyville: A Magical History Tour of The Chicago Cubs. YOGI BERRA and TED WILLIAMS are both members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. SELBY KIFFER is senior vice president of the Department of Books and Manuscripts, Sotheby's New York.</p></p><p>"By pursuing his avocation with the ferocity and determination of Ty Cobb stretching a two-base hit into a triple, Barry Halper assembled the world's largest and most significant private collection on baseball, an achievement that should be ranked with the great American collections of the American century...." This quote from Sotheby's auction catalog underscores the importance of Barry Halper, not only to the sports-memorabilia world but also to baseball history. During a 50-year stretch, Halper gathered over 100,000 items from the great game, including a 1912 World Series program signed by "Smokey" Joe Wood and President Woodrow Wilson, a ticket stub from the Lou Gehrig memorial game, and Mickey Mantle's 1956 Triple Crown Trophy. The entire legendary lot was offered in two separate auctions in 1999: one live at Sotheby's New York headquarters and the other via the Internet at http://www.sothebys.amazon.com.<p> The handsome, slipcased catalog includes three volumes highlighting the event. The first two contain over 2,000 photographs (most in color), plus detailed descriptions and estimated auction prices of the items; the items are divided into 16 sale sessions arranged chronologically and by theme. The third volume examines the history of baseball and includes a timeline of the sport's past as well as essays written by Yogi Berra, Ted Williams, and others. An essential resource for bidders, this catalog also makes an outstanding addition to any sports fan's library. <i>--Andy Boynton</i></p>From the Foreword <p>Willie Mays once explained that, for him, baseball was a simple game: "If they throw it, I hit it; if they hit it, I catch it." Barry Halper has followed a similarly fundamental - and similarly effective- approach to collecting our national pastime: if baseball players threw it, hit it, or caught it (or wore it, signed it, endorsed it, inspired it, or posed for it), Barry collected it. By pursuing his avocation with the ferocity and determination of Ty Cobb stretching a two-base hit into a triple, Barry Halper assembled the world's largest and most significant private collection on baseball, an achievement that should be ranked with the great American collections of the American century and not simply with other major accumulations of sports memorabilia. </p> <p>In size and scope, the Halper Collection resembles a Continental country house sale, in which thousands of diverse items accumulated by generations of occupants are brought at once under the auctioneer's hammer - the rare and the common, the valuable and the inexpensive, the grand and the negligible, the famous and the obscure. And, truth be told, Barry has been collecting for "generations" - almost exactly fifty years. </p> <p>One of the great beauties of baseball is that is has no game clock; time never runs out if a team can continue to rally during its innings. The same is not true of the auction of the Barry Halper Collection. Collectors are being offered a seven day series of live auctions, and extra innings in the form of Internet bidding, but when the last lot is knocked down, the clock will run out, for there can never be another assemblage to rival the Barry Halper Collection. "Whoever wants to know the heart and mind of America,' Jacques Barzun observed, 'had better learn baseball." The enduring legacy of Barry Halper is that those who want to learn baseball will continue to study this catalogue long after the auction has ended."</p></p><h2>Faerie Lights</h2><p>Twenty-four designs for creating colorful and enchanting fairies of all types&#x2014;from Xaniane the crystal warrior to Whisper the princess of innocence&#x2014;are featured in this guide to stained glass.

The tale repeatedly bogs down in the uninspired ruminations of the hero and heroine as they rehash what's going on around them. And a dreary "one-eyed" villain also doesn't enliven the action any. Royce Manchester, an American in London, doesn't know the reason for the Earl of St. Audries's ill-repute, but when Royce nabs Pip, a pickpocket who tried to rob him at a boxing match, he notes in passing the youth's strong resemblance to the arrogant earl. Prodded by a kind-hearted companion, Royce reluctantly agrees to give a job to Pip, who turns out to be a beautiful young woman named Morgana Fowler. However, the thief Morgana answered to, a shadowy man who knows her true parentage, plots to regain control of her. Royce, infatuated with Morgana, extends his protection to the young woman and soon makes her his mistress, bringing him into direct conflict with a murderer whose influence extends from England's sewers to its most fashionable drawing rooms. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cooking with Asterix</h2><p>This recipe book features the characters from the Asterix books.

Berlo (Native American art, Univ. of Missouri, St. Louis) manages to bring together multiple viewpoints that enlarge this subject, opening it out to a richer social and historical context. Based on an engaging exhibition organized by the Drawing Center, New York, and the American Federation of Arts, the volume offers essays, artists' statements, and catalog entries that more fully illuminate the work of 36 Plains Indian artists. Although there have been several publications on those Plains Indian ledger drawings created while the artists were in federal prisons, this book covers the reservation period, when the richest work was produced. The picture that emerges is a more fully realized perspective on what this art meant to its creators. This study offers a vigorous examination of narrative Native American art in transition and contains a wealth of new, and even previously unknown, details on Plains Indian drawing. An essential acquisition for academic collections where Native American culture and art intersect.?Paula A. Baxter, NYPL<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Whereas their forebears traditionally drew on buffalo hides, nineteenth-century Plains Indians transferred this artistic genre onto inventory ledger books that were often already filled with lists in spidery writing. Earlier winter accountings of events, which is what the drawings are, depicted victories and continuing struggle, but those from this period illustrate an accelerating spiral of loss and defeat. A line of uniformed Indian prisoners is shown being photographed, while another is being pressed through military drills. Still, there is also transcription of traditional ways, such as the Caddo stomp dance, the Kiowa honoring song, and the sun dance. Excellent scholarly introductions set the historical and artistic contexts for the colorplates of the drawings. An especially interesting section provides commentary by four contemporary Native American artists on the ongoing influence of these seemingly childlike sketches. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i></p><h2>Cellar Girl</h2><p><p><b>The story of one&nbsp;heroic&nbsp;woman who survived kidnap by a notorious&nbsp;serial rapist and&nbsp;killer in 1980s Philadelphia</b></p><p><i>"I stood there for a moment, silently speaking to myself: Josefina, you will survive this.

Surprisingly, secret Japanese planes of World War 2 remain an area that has been largely ignored due to scarcity of information. They do, however, have a large base of interest as unlike the majority of secret Luftwaffe programs that were resigned to the drawing board, the vast number of aircraft featured within this book actually flew or were in development. <p>The book is divided into two sections dedicated to the air forces of the IJA and IJN, with over 42 aircraft examined, each with its history, variants, performance, and any combat records laid out in an easy to read fashion. Much information about their secret technical exchanges with the Luftwaffe throughout the war is also uncovered. This is beautifully complimented by stunning color renditions of the aircraft in combat and color profiles of genuine markings and camouflage. Notable emphasis is placed upon the transonic rammer aircraft, strategic long-range bombers, and the ways in which the Japanese adapted German technology to their needs, particularly the Me262 and Me 163 Komet. Secret Japanese armaments are also covered in detail, with information on guided missiles, aerial rockets, and unique bombs.

And out of this egg came one big, humongous . . . something. "It's big!" clucked the little rooster. "It's enormous!" clucked the small chicken. "It's anelephant!" peeped the smallest chicken. "Run for your lives!" they cried. No matter how they try, these clueless chickens can't make sense of the gigantic new member of their familyuntil he saves the day. With wacky, laugh-out-loud humor and silliness to spare, this BIG twist on the classic <em>Chicken Little</em> story lends a whole new perspective to what it means to be chicken.</p><p>Keith Graves is Professor Emeritus at the Chicken School in Austin, Texas, where he teaches courses in chicken history. Strangely, he has the same name as another guy who wrote the book Frank Was a Monster Who Wanted to Dance, as well as some other ridiculous books, but we doubt he&#39;s the same guyPreS-Gr 2&#x2013;The pint-size poultry are as brainless as ever in this quirky revision of the classic &#x201c;Chicken Little&#x201d; tale, but the hero here is mysterious Chicken Big. Is he an elephant? The smaller chickens are sure that he could not be one of them and exclude him from the coop. When an acorn falls on the smallest one's head, she thinks the sky is falling. But when clear-headed Chicken Big explains what it is and pops it into his mouth, the other chickens decide that he must really be a squirrel. Chicken Big's unwilling companions arrive at one ridiculous conclusion after another. He protects them from the rain, so he could be an umbrella. He keeps them warm in a cold breeze, so he could be a sweater. When all the eggs go missing and Chicken Big saves the day, the others realize that &#x201c;only one thing could be so smart, so kind, so warm, and so brave.&#x201d; (A chicken, of course.) Graves's pastel-hued illustrations with comic-style panels have a spontaneous and quirky quality reminiscent of Mo Willems's Pigeon and Leonardo books, and thoughtful design plays up the disproportionate size of Chicken Big. An amusing tale that will draw giggles from preschool and early elementary read-aloud audiences, this is a fun addition to any collection or comparative folklore unit.<i>Jayne Damron, Farmington Community Library, MI</i><br>ï¿½ Copyright 2010.

The wealth of drawings, field observations, and fascinating bird facts make this a useful reference and irresistible collectible.</p></p><p>Maryjo Koch has over 300,000 copies of her nature book titles in print, including the best-selling Bird Egg Feather Nest. She also has created an array of successful gift product based on her work, including greeting cards, wrapping paper, plates and mugs, and two lines of wallpaper. Her paintings and prints are featured in select specialty shops internationally and have been exhibited at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. Gretel Ehrlich is an American storywriter and poet, heralded by Annie Dillard as the &#34;Walt Whitman of Wyoming.&#34; She is the author of 14 published works, including A Match to the Heart: One Woman&#39;s Story of Being Struck by Lightning, Solace of Open Spaces, The Horse Whisperer: An Illustrated Companion to the Major Motion Picture.A nest is a cup of space, a swinging cradle, an anchored platform, a wedge between boulders, a pocket in bark or dirt, a scrape on a rock, a dent in sand. It represents the still point in a bird's fast-paced life, the place where the wingbeat of the hummingbird-vibrating at twenty to eighty times per second-is quieted; where the California Condor's soaring flight to 15,000 feet is brought down to earth. It's where the Red-tail Hawk's shrill whistle falls silent, its thick talons folding softly over white eggs. <p>Birds live intensely because they are physiologically able to do so. Their metabolisms are speedy, their hearts are large, they have air sacs tucked all over their tiny bodies to facilitate circulation and breathing, their bones are hollow, and their feathers keep them warm and keep them flying. Arctic Terns fly eleven thousand miles a year, soaring from one Pole to the other and live in almost continual daylight. Passerines have been seen to make more than a thousand trips carrying material to their nests. One bald eagle's nest, which can take two months to build, measured over eight feet across, twelve feet deep, and weighed two tons. </p><p>The making of the nest is initially inspired by environmental, seasonal, and demographic details as well as the release of hormones, but as with all endeavors of sentient beings, aesthetic elements also figure in the planning. And once the nest-building instinct is triggered, almost nothing will stop it. </p><p>Some nests are built new each year, or rebuilt using the same material, or as in the case of the Vermilion Flycatcher, nests are stolen from another bird and doubled up for extra cushioning. One third of all birds use cavities or make no real nest at all, but merely kick a place in the sand as the plovers do or, like vultures and condors, rest their eggs on a gravel or stone floor. Other nests are used over and over again: an eagle's eyrie lasted thirty-six years until the tree in which it was built fell down, a white stork's nest in Europe was chronicled and noted to be in use from 1549 to 1930. </p><p>Nests can be large, loose, course, globular, compact, frail, deeply cupped, shallow, bulky, or tightly woven and can swing in the wind from the end of a tree branch. Nest materials can include almost anything that can be carried. The list sounds like a witches' brew: saliva, spider silk, feather down, guano, cow manure, snakeskin, hair, fur, dustballs, shells, flowers, small rocks, lichen, moss, leaves, leaf mold, bark, cellulose, horsehair, paper scraps, insulation, tree branches, and twigs.</p></p><h2>Stardance</h2><p>First American paperback edition.

As she stood on the bridge of the <i>U.S.S. Defiant</i> and studied the surreal image displayed on its main viewer, such feelings once again taunted her and dared her to submit to their stifling embrace. </p><p> Along with Captain David Gold and Soloman, she watched as the interdimensional rift continued to mend itself, sealing the <i>Defiant</i> inside this pocket of chaos ambiguously known as "interphase" and separating them from the <i>U.S.S. da Vinci</i> and their entire universe. At the moment, helplessness seemed almost appropriate. </p><p> The mission, like so many others Gomez had undertaken since joining the Starfleet Corps of Engineers, had started out easily enough. Daunting and compelling from both technical and historical perspectives, the task of retrieving the <i>Defiant</i> had energized the entire <i>da Vinci</i> crew, from Captain Gold on down. The recovery of the fabled ship, lost for more than a century after becoming trapped in an interspatial pocket connecting this universe with another, presented a unique engineering challenge. When the ship disappeared in 2268, most scientific minds throughout the Federation believed that it had been lost in the other universe with no hope of being recovered. </p><p> That belief had held true until two weeks ago, when a Tholian vessel had discovered the <i>Defiant,</i> still trapped in the interdimensional rift but now visible again for the first time in more than a century. The circumstances leading to the ship's reappearance after so long remained a mystery and the Tholians, in their typical fashion, had not been forthcoming with any potentially helpful information. </p><p> <i>And we could sure use that info now,</i> Gomez mused. </p><p> She had led an away team to the <i>Defiant</i> with the task of restoring minimal power to the derelict vessel. Working with Kieran Duffy, the <i>da Vinci'</i>s propulsion specialist, she had decided that the <i>Defiant'</i>s maneuvering thrusters could be used to help extract the ship from the rift, with the help of the <i>da Vinci</i>'s tractor beam. Duffy and his team had also modified the <i>da Vinci</i>'s navigational deflector to stabilize the <i>Defiant'</i>s hull and make it easier for the tractor beam to lock onto the trapped ship. </p><p> Of course, it wouldn't have been an S.C.E. mission if the <i>Defiant</i> hadn't yielded a few surprises of its own. </p><p> First had been the condition of the ship itself. Drained of power, the <i>Defiant</i> was a lifeless hulk, dark and foreboding as the away team materialized in the depths of its engineering section. Then there were the remains of the ship's crew, drifting free throughout the vessel's interior in the absence of gravity. The nightmarish scene had caught Gomez off guard and caused her no small amount of anxiety. Her reaction to the situation troubled her, but she had managed to keep her unease at bay to this point by concentrating on the tasks at hand. </p><p> But then the Tholians had inexplicably fired on the <i>Defiant,</i> disrupting the <i>da Vinci'</i>s attempt to pull the century-old ship from the interspatial void and instead throwing the <i>Defiant</i> back into the rift. The action had the further effect of collapsing the pocket around the ship, trapping it and the <i>da Vinci</i> away team within the confines of interspace. </p><p> "The weapons fire could have disturbed the fabric of space near the rift," Gomez said as she studied the viewscreen. "The area is already so unstable, any kind of disruption would probably be enough to affect it." </p><p> Turning away from the viewscreen, Gold said, "Something similar was reported in the old <i>Enterprise</i> logs when they discovered the <i>Defiant.</i> It had the effect of throwing off the interphase timetable. The <i>Defiant</i> still continued to appear and reappear, but they had to recalculate the intervals." </p><p> "That means the <i>da Vinci</i> can probably still get us out," Gomez said. </p><p> "Maybe," Gold replied as he stepped toward the starboard side of the command well. "But first we need to make sure the ship won't fall apart around us." He turned his attention to the science station. "Soloman, do we have internal sensors? Can you give us a damage report?" </p><p> The Bynar keyed commands to the science console as his face was bathed in the soft blue light of the station's viewfinder. Several moments passed as he reviewed the information supplied by the <i>Defiant'</i>s limited sensors. </p><p> "There are... hull breaches on decks eight, thirteen and... fifteen," he reported. "There is also some buckling... in the port warp nacelle." As he turned away from the viewfinder, the Bynar added, "The damage is minor, given the... intensity of the attack, Captain. We were... most fortunate." </p><p> Gomez sighed in relief. "I'll say. If that's the extent of the damage, then we should be okay even under the pull of the <i>da Vinc'i</i>s tractor beam." </p><p> "If she's still there," Gold said, drawing shocked expressions from Gomez and Soloman. The <i>da Vinci'</i>s commanding officer didn't acknowledge the looks, however, instead adding, "She may have been disabled or destroyed by the Tholians, or Mr. Duffy has obeyed my orders and taken her out of the area. Either way, we may not be able to rely on the <i>da Vinci</i> to get us out of here." </p><p> "Even if the rift was open," Gomez said, "the <i>Defiant'</i>s maneuvering thrusters aren't enough to push us out on their own." The generators they had brought with them from the <i>da Vinci</i> would never be enough to power the ship's massive impulse engines, to say nothing about the warp drive. </p><p> Gold shrugged. "Then we'll just have to find another way, won't we?" </p><p> "Captain," Gomez said, "what if we <i>do</i> get out? The Tholians could be waiting on the other side of the rift for us. We'd be sitting ducks." </p><p> "Given a choice between waiting here for who knows what to happen or taking our chances in normal space," Gold replied, "I choose the latter option." </p><p> The chirp of his suit communicator interrupted their conversation; it was followed by the voice of Dr. Elizabeth Lense, the <i>da Vinci'</i>s chief medical officer. </p><p> "Lense to Captain Gold. I have an emergency situation and require assistance." </p><p> "Doctor?" Gold called out, his voice rising a notch. "Are you all right? What about Pattie?" </p><p> Shortly after beaming to the <i>Defiant,</i> P8 Blue, the S.C.E. team's resident Nasat engineer, had detected an odd power source emanating from deep within the ship. Gold had sent her and Dr. Lense to investigate, and they had found a strange device of Tholian design stored in one of the ship's cargo holds. To the best of Gold's knowledge, Pattie and Lense had remained down there during the Tholian attack. He had sudden visions of the pair caught in a maelstrom of cargo containers and equipment tumbling about the cargo hold free from the restraints of gravity, and Pattie and Lense frantically seeking cover from the potentially lethal assault. </p><p> "I am uninjured," Lense replied to the captain, miraculously maintaining her composed tone of voice, "but we are not in the cargo bay. During the attack, a section of the hull destabilized and Pattie fell out into space. As she was already unconscious, I had no choice but to follow." </p><p> "What?" Gold said. "You mean you're drifting in space outside the ship?" </p><p> "No, sir. I managed to get us back, but by then the hull had solidified again. I am standing on the exterior of the ship, and I can find no sign of an airlock or other entry point. Pattie has sustained a concussion. She needs medical treatment." </p><p> Gold looked to Gomez. "Transporters? Can we beam her directly to the bridge?" </p><p> The engineer shook her head.

The Celts and Germans inhabiting temperate Europe before the arrival of the Romans left no written record of their lives and were often dismissed as "barbarians" by the Romans who conquered them. Accounts by Julius Caesar and a handful of other Roman and Greek writers would lead us to think that prior to contact with the Romans, European natives had much simpler political systems, smaller settlements, no evolving social identities, and that they practiced human sacrifice. A more accurate, sophisticated picture of the indigenous people emerges, however, from the archaeological remains of the Iron Age. Here Peter Wells brings together information that has belonged to the realm of specialists and enables the general reader to share in the excitement of rediscovering a "lost people." In so doing, he is the first to marshal material evidence in a broad-scale examination of the response by the Celts and Germans to the Roman presence in their lands.</p><p>The recent discovery of large pre-Roman settlements throughout central and western Europe has only begun to show just how complex native European societies were before the conquest. Remnants of walls, bone fragments, pottery, jewelry, and coins tell much about such activities as farming, trade, and religious ritual in their communities; objects found at gravesites shed light on the richly varied lives of individuals. Wells explains that the presence--or absence--of Roman influence among these artifacts reveals a range of attitudes toward Rome at particular times, from enthusiastic acceptance among urban elites to creative resistance among rural inhabitants. In fascinating detail, Wells shows that these societies did grow more cosmopolitan under Roman occupation, but that the people were much more than passive beneficiaries; in many cases they helped determine the outcomes of Roman military and political initiatives. This book is at once a provocative, alternative reading of Roman history and a catalyst for overturning long-standing assumptions about nonliterate and indigenous societies.</p></p><p><p>"<i>The Barbarians Speak</i> is an important book. It is the first to address the question of Roman-native interaction in Europe from the perspective of anthropological archaeology rather than a historical form of archaeology, which privileges the Roman side of the story."<b>--Peter Bogucki, Princeton University</b></p><p>"This book by Peter Wells has the potential to change the way we look at Europe during the years of the Roman Empire.

Eva Schloss, like her schoolmate Anne Frank, was deported to Auschwitz while in her teens, and in this absorbing memoir--a story she has withheld from even her closest friends for nearly forty-five years--she recounts the terror she and Anne and thousands of Jewish girls like them knew.<br>Eva Schloss's personal history represents in microcosm the ever intensifying process of degradation and destruction of European Jewish life that began even before the Second World War. Born to successful parents in Vienna, Eva and her family were forced by the German annexation of Austria to seek refuge, first in Belgium, then in Holland, giving up their friends, their accustomed way of life, and their livelihoods. With each move, their freedom became more limited, until their entire world was encompassed by the tiny hidden rooms in Amsterdam apartments provided by a network of neighbors and friends who became increasingly unreliable as the Nazi occupation clamped down. For two years they lived this way, Eva with her mother, Eva's father and brother secluded elsewhere. On Eva's fifteenth birthday, the family was reunited--by the Gestapo. Soon they were on board the cattle cars to Auschwitz.<br>There, their concerns turned from evading capture to fighting death. Again the family was separated. Eva's hopes of returning with her family to freedom, fueled by occasional clandestine meetings with her father, were constantly dashed by the reality of the prison camp's barbarism, by the ever-present fear of being "selected," either for the gas chambers or--what was worse--for Dr. Mengele's infamous experiments.<br>This moving first-person account, told without rancor or sentimentality, is a testament to the power of human beings to survive and even triumph in the most inhumane of circumstances. Eva's Story, while a lasting contribution to the literature of the Holocaust, speaks directly to everyone.</p><p>Eva Schloss and Evelyn Julia KentAlmost 50 years now separate the children of today from the generation of Jewish children who perished in the Holocaust. Perhaps this is one factor that compelled two women, both now grandmothers, to record the painful years they spent as young girls in the death camps of Poland. Libraries probably will find more demand for Eva's Story , since Schloss is the posthumous stepsister of Anne Frank, whom she knew in Amsterdam. With her family she was able to rely on a network of Dutch Gentiles to hide her through the first years of World War II. On her 15th birthday, however, informers betrayed her, her mother, father, and sister. Deported to Auschwitz, she survived thanks to a combination of luck and the fierce love she and her mother shared. Graf, a Polish Jew, was a university student when the German invasion shattered her world. She survived the first years of the German occupation by fleeing to Soviet-occupied sections of Poland. But, like Schloss, her luck ran out. Her camp, Plaszow, equaled Auschwitz in terrors. Again, like Schloss, Graf relied upon the deep affection and support of her sisters to survive. Both books are recommended for their demonstration that courage, familial love, and an inner resistance still flourished even in the deepest horrors of the Holocaust.<br><i>- Ann H.

J. Simpson, and more. 30,000 first printing. $35,000 ad/promo. Doubleday. Tour.</p><p>In the foreword to this book, Michael (<i>Unnatural Death: Confessions of a Medical Examiner</i>) Baden, M.D. says that Cyril Wecht, M.D., J.D. ("no shrinking violet") has selected from his 35-year career "a fascinating batch of cases in which his knowledge as a forensic pathologist was crucial in exposing official mistakes or otherwise illuminating weaknesses in the criminal justice system." <p> <i>Grave Secrets</i> brings out interesting forensic details in the following cases in which Dr. Wecht was personally involved: (1) the O. J. Simpson murder and civil trials (Wecht has an intriguing theory), (2) the death of Vincent Foster, (3) the Branch Davidian tragedy at Waco, (4) a racially-charged shootout in Cleveland in 1968, (5) a 1969 Black Panther episode, (6) alleged negligence after the 1989 Oakland earthquake, (7) a 1977 nightclub fire in Kentucky, (8-9) two unrelated deaths in Taiwan--a visiting Chinese-American professor and a Chinese activist, (10) the alleged poisoning of a Pakistani general, (11) the controversial murder of a Filipino maid in Singapore, (12) the swine flu scare of 1976, (13) a possible mob connection in the suspicious conviction of a Connecticut man for murdering his family, and (14) the "alien autopsy" footage from Roswell, New Mexico. (Note: Dr. Wecht, along with coauthors Mark Curridwen and Benjamin Wecht, also wrote <i>Cause of Death</i>&gt;. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Pathologist Wecht, author of Cause of Death (Dutton, 1993), relates 14 cases involving forensic detection. Ignore the hyperbole of the tag line: "A leading forensic expert reveals the startling truth about O.J. Simpson, David Koresh, Vincent Foster, and other sensational cases." There is nothing very startling in Wecht's discussion of Vincent Foster and David Koresh, and, in the book's longest section, he is uncharacteristically circumspect about O.J. Simpson. His less recent investigations, including the murder of Black Panther Fred Hampton, the 1989 earthquake-caused Oakland, California, freeway collapse, and the Legionnaire's Disease case of 1976 and his sojourns to Taiwan, Pakistan, and Singapore, are more intriguing. A common theme in his book is the misdiagnosis or injustice caused by forensic incompetence, overzealousness, or corruption. Popular forensic accounts seem to be in vogue (Colin Evan's The Casebook of Forensic Detection is coming in October from John Wiley) and Grave Secrets is a suitable addition where interest warrants.<br><i>-?Gregor A.

Saadiah Gaon, who initiated the controversy, claimed that the Psalter was a second Torah--the Lord's word to David--and by no means man's prayer to God. Salmon ben Yerucham and Yefet ben Ali insisted on the Karaite view that the Book of Psalms was the prophetic common prayerbook of Israel. Totally opposing both of these concepts, Rabbi Moses Ibn Giqatilah regarded the Psalms as non-prophetic prayers authored by different poets, beginning with David and ending with the captive Levites in the Babylonian exile. Finally, Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra reverted to the belief held by the Talmudic sages--that the Psalms were Israel's divinely inspired and most sacred poetry. <p></p>The book also includes the full text of a previously unknown introduction to Ibn Ezra's lost commentary on the Psalms, which is much more elaborate and revealing than the introduction to his familiar classical commentary.</p><p><p>Uriel Simon is Professor of Bible and Co-director of the Institute for the History of Jewish Bible Research at Bar-Ilan University, Israel.

His AUTOBIOGRAPHY is now an established classic of modern America, a book that expresses like none other the crucial truth about our times.<br>"Extraordinary. A brilliant, painful, important book."<br>TEH NEW YORKTIMES</p><p>Malcolm X's searing memoir belongs on the small shelf of great autobiographies. The reasons are many: the blistering honesty with which he recounts his transformation from a bitter, self-destructive petty criminal into an articulate political activist, the continued relevance of his militant analysis of white racism, and his emphasis on self-respect and self-help for African Americans. And there's the vividness with which he depicts black popular culture--try as he might to criticize those lindy hops at Boston's Roseland dance hall from the perspective of his Muslim faith, he can't help but make them sound pretty wonderful. These are but a few examples. <i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i> limns an archetypal journey from ignorance and despair to knowledge and spiritual awakening. When Malcolm tells coauthor Alex Haley, "People don't realize how a man's whole life can be changed by one book," he voices the central belief underpinning every attempt to set down a personal story as an example for others. Although many believe his ethic was directly opposed to Martin Luther King Jr.'s during the civil rights struggle of the '60s, the two were not so different. Malcolm may have displayed a most un-Christian distaste for loving his enemies, but he understood with King that love of God and love of self are the necessary first steps on the road to freedom. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Through a life of passion and struggle, Malcolm X became one of the most influential figures of the 20th Century. In this riveting account, he tells of his journey from a prison cell to Mecca, describing his transition from hoodlum to Muslim minister. Here, the man who called himself "the angriest Black man in America" relates how his conversion to true Islam helped him confront his rage and recognize the brotherhood of all mankind. An established classic of modern America, <i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i> was hailed by the New York Times as "Extraordinary. A brilliant, painful, important book." Still extraordinary, still important, this electrifying story has transformed Malcom X's life into his legacy. The strength of his words, the power of his ideas continue to resonate more than a generation after they first appeared.</p><h2>Taste of Scotland: In Food and in Pictures</h2><p>(Not just another recipe book about traditional Scottish fare.

In An Extraordinary Year of Ordinary Days, best-selling mystery novelist Susan Wittig Albert invites us to revisit one of the most tumultuous years in recent memory, 2008, through the lens of 365 ordinary days in which her reading, writing, and thinking about issues in the wider world&#x2014;from wars and economic recession to climate change&#x2014;caused her to reconsider and reshape daily practices in her personal life.</p><p>Albert's journal provides an engaging account of how the business of being a successful working writer blends with her rural life in the Texas Hill Country and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of New Mexico. As her eclectic daily reading ranges across topics from economics, food production, and oil and energy policy to poetry, place, and the writing life, Albert becomes increasingly concerned about the natural world and the threats facing it, especially climate change and resource depletion. Asking herself, "What does it mean? And what ought I do about it?", she determines practical steps to take, such as growing more food in her garden, and also helps us as readers make sense of these issues and consider what our own responses might be.</p></p><p>SUSAN WITTIG ALBERT is the author of popular mysteries, including the acclaimed China Bayles series; books for young adults; and books for women on life-writing and work. A graduate of the University of Illinois (Urbana) and the University of California at Berkeley, she is a former university English professor and administrator. In 1997, she founded the Story Circle Network, a nonprofit organization for women who want to write about their lives."Her journal reads as smoothly as a letter written to a dear friend; a treasure trove of quotes from favorite authors and suggested readings on relevant subjects enhance each page. More than the rudimentary musings of a popular author who has grown with the times, this multi-faceted journal serves as a valuable overview to the way we were."

In many ways Iceberg Slim's most mature fictional work,&nbsp;<i>Shetani's Sister</i>&nbsp;relates, in taut, evocative vernacular torn straight from the street corner, the deadly duel between two complex anitheroes: Sergeant Russell Rucker, an LAPD vice detective attempting to clean up street prostitution and police corruption, and Shetani (Swahili for Satan), a veteran master pimp who controls his stable of whores with violence and daily doses of heroin.</p><p>Iceberg Slim, also known as Robert Beck, was born in Chicago in 1918 and was initiated into the life of the pimp at age 18. He briefly attended the Tuskegee Institute but dropped out to return to the streets of the South Side, where he remained, pimping until he was 42. After several stints in jail he decided to give up the life and turned to writing, crafting most famously his autobiographical classic,&nbsp;<i>Pimp: The Story of My Life</i>.

You can, too. This book outlines my discovery and recovery from interstitial cystitis. I discovered I had an acid-alkali imbalance and this knowledge led me on my path to recovery. Without medications and painful medical procedures, I have regained my life naturally and holistically by following a few simple guidelines.</p><p>Solve the Interstitial Cystitis Puzzle! <p> Interstitial cystitis is a syndrome that affects approximately one million people in the United States. This is considered a conservative estimate because many IC sufferers are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. It affects women ten times more than men. In reference to a landmark epidemiological study, a conservative average annual cost estimate of treating interstitial cystitis in the United States is $1.7 billion, or about $1,700 per patient. </p> <p> Building upon years of solid research the book, Solving the Interstitial Cystitis Puzzle: My Story of Discovery and Recovery, explains how the author overcame the debilitating effects of interstitial cystitis and offers steps the reader can follow to do the same. By thoroughly understanding the importance of an alkali-forming diet and lifestyle, the reader, too, can regain a normal lifestyle. The author thoroughly explains how the bodyï¿½s pH along with food allergies contributes to interstitial cystitis. </p> <p> No other books have been authored to address the topic of acid and alkali imbalances and their effects on interstitial cystitis. Without medications or painful medical procedures, the reader should be able to conquer interstitial cystitis, and health care professionals will be armed with therapeutic information they can pass along to their patients.</p>In my search for my recovery from interstitial cystitis, I discovered several books that address health issues with respect to the pH of the body. I was aware that in the IC community it is common knowledge that persons with IC are intolerant of acidic foods and beverages. It is also known in the IC community that alkalizing elements can reduce the symptoms of interstitial cystitis. In my research, I uncovered that an alkali-forming diet can neutralize the acid load in oneï¿½s body and thereby assist in restoring oneï¿½s health. I wrote this book as a resource for persons suffering from interstitial cystitis because it seems so many of us have been unable to see the forest from the trees. It has been suggested that IC is a syndrome with a variety of origins, and I found this to be true. When one consumes an acid-forming diet, as most Americans do, drink acidic beverages, inhale contaminated acidic air, and live fast-paced stressful lives, one is going to develop a severe acid load in the body that must be neutralized. In order to bring about a balance and neutralize and escort out the acids stored in cells of the body, I discovered this could be done simply and naturally with a change in diet and lifestyle.

Leder has served since 1986 at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple in Los Angeles, the oldest and most prestigious synagogue in Southern California. He is the author of "The Extraordinary Nature of Ordinary Things" (Behrman House, 1999), and his articles have been seen in publications including the "Los Angeles Times" and the "Los Angeles Jewish Journal." He has been quoted in "TIME" magazine and has been a guest on ABC-TV&#x2019;s "Politically Incorrect" and on National Public Radio. He received the Louis Rapoport Award for Excellence in Commentary by the American Jewish Press Association, and the Kovler Award from the Religious Action Center in Washington, D.C., for his work on African-American and Jewish relations. He lives with his wife and two children in Los Angeles.Gold is not a problem unless we fashion it into a calf to worship, according to this engaging volume of moral instruction. Leder, a rabbi and author of The Extraordinary Nature of Ordinary Things, addresses the spiritual problems of accumulating and then liquidating wealth in a responsible fashion, reminding readers that wisdom, family, friendship, fulfillment and ethics all take precedence over mammon. His ecumenical approach invokes the teachings of Buddha, Christ and Abe Lincoln, but maintains a characteristically Jewish tone of religious obligation tempered by common sense and infused with a concern for social justice. Practical advice abounds, on tithing (a tenth-at least-of one's income should go to charity); on money and kids (make them work for it, and no credit cards before college); on business ethics (reasonable profits are okay, but don't take advantage of another person's ignorance of the market); on workaholism (keep the Sabbath holy, because "we must put limits on the degree to which we are willing to sell our soul for a dollar"); and on loans to relatives (better to co-sign than to lend outright). There's nothing surprising in these ageless verities, but Leder conveys them with a mixture of parables, proverbs, jokes and sermonettes (on, among other things, why marriage is a lot like fishing for halibut) that keeps them fresh. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He moved to San Francisco at fifteen, spent two years in Paris painting, returned to San Francisco to become an internationally famous author, and died at age thirty-two from a ruptured appendix. During his short life, he wrote an inspired series of novels about the United States coming of age, including <i>The Octopus, The Pit,</i> and <i>McTeague.</i> Until recently, various obstacles prevented a comprehensive biography of Norris: the writer burned most of his correspondence, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire devoured more, and his brother and widow dispersed his surviving papers as gifts.

Some of the most striking series of images in the book are the unique camouflage paintings from a French publication dating back to 1920 which the Imperial War Museum reproduced for their Camouflage exhibition.<br><br>Author Tim Newark provides a field guide to camouflage from conception to uses, colors to key patterns including the German uniforms of World War II, the iconic American uniforms worn during Vietnam, the British DPM, and all the way up to the varied patterns in use in the armies of present day.

This young raccoon pair loves to do everything together, like dress in striped sweaters, read the same stories, and even eat the same lunch -- a crawfish sandwich, huckleberries, and milk. But when Stripe arrives one day at school in a mischief-making mood and starts stirring up trouble in Mr. Ringtail's class, should Hunter follow along?</p><p>Laura Malone Elliott and Lynn Munsinger introduce two delightful pals who will entertain young children as they also provide an important look at peer pressure and first friendships.</p></p><p><p>Laura Malone Elliott is the author of the award-winning Hunter's <em>Best Friend at School</em>, <em>Hunter's Big Sister</em>, and <em>Hunter and Stripe and the Soccer Showdown</em>, also illustrated by Lynn Munsinger, as well as books for older readers (written as L.

She divides her time between Vermont, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.</p>Best friends and school join in Elliott's (Under a War-Torn Sky) tale for a kid-pleasing combination and Munsinger's (The Teeny Tiny Ghost) comical, sometimes poignant illustrations give this picture book a double draw. Young raccoons Hunter and Stripe are fast friends who like "all the same things" and display contagious smiles as they make the rounds at recess, share a beloved book and munch on their mutually favorite lunch of crawfish sandwiches, huckleberries and milk. But one day Stripe comes to school "in a mischief-making mood" and goads Hunter into following his bad example. When Hunter's mother finds out from her son that he felt compelled to follow his pal's lead since "We do everything together," she delivers the tale's gentle moral: "Being a best friend doesn't mean always following along. Sometimes being a best friend means you have to help your friend be his best self." The following day, Hunter takes her advice and successfully demonstrates a positive role model for his pal. Adults will surely appreciate the message about resisting peer pressure, but Stripe snaps into good-behavior mode a bit too speedily to be entirely credible and the story winds up on a sticky-sweet note.

In recent decades, however, this image has been severely critiqued, with a growing number of studies highlighting persistent and deep-seated patterns of racial discrimination and inequality. Yet, recent work on race and racism has rarely considered gender as part of its analysis. <br><br>In <i>Negras in Brazil</i>, Kia Lilly Caldwell examines the life experiences of Afro-Brazilian women whose stories have until now been largely untold. This pathbreaking study analyzes the links between race and gender and broader processes of social, economic, and political exclusion. Drawing on ethnographic research with social movement organizations and thirty-five life history interviews, Caldwell explores the everyday struggles Afro-Brazilian women face in their efforts to achieve equal rights and full citizenship. She also shows how the black women's movement, which has emerged in recent decades, has sought to challenge racial and gender discrimination in Brazil. While proposing a broader view of citizenship that includes domains such as popular culture and the body, <i>Negras in Brazil</i> highlights the continuing relevance of identity politics for members of racially marginalized communities. Providing new insights into black women's social activism and a gendered perspective on Brazilian racial dynamics, this book will be of interest to students and scholars of Latin American Studies, African diaspora studies, women's studies, politics, and cultural anthropology.</p><p>Kia Lilly Caldwell is an assistant professor in the department of African and Afro-American studies at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.<i>Negras in Brazil</i> is at the cutting edge of post-modern anthropology and achieves new ways to clarify and explicate complex conundrums of race and gender. This account is about Brazil, but it is one that reaches across borders.

Though based on interviews, transcripts and other factual records, the tales are recounted as nonfiction short stories including an account of the double suicide of the Marcus twins, Manhattan gynecologists, which Wolfe expanded into a novel, Private Practices. These accounts have powerful narrative interest and the author explores background and psychological forces as clues to her subjects' behavior.

His orderly, upwardly mobile life is thrown into chaos by the sudden appearance of his nutty mother, who&#x2019;s been deserted by T.&#x2019;s now out-of-the-closet father. After his mother&#x2019;s suicide attempt and two other deaths, T. finds himself increasingly estranged from his latest project: a retirement community in the middle of the California desert.

This first full-length study of her life and work shows that her powerfully original treatments of mythic-heroic female subjects depart radically from traditional interpretations of the same themes.</p></p><p>Garrard's in-depth study of Renaissance/Baroque painter Gentileschi is both timely and necessary. First, Garrard examines the life and work of the painter: the training with her artist father, the debt to Michelangelo and Caravaggio, the biblical and classical themes prevalent among her contemporaries, stylistic concerns, and her popularity, much-publicized rape, and influence. Then, using this information as context, Garrard proceeds to interpret the pictorial and spiritual contents of Gentileschi's paintings, contending that, while no one gainsays Gentileschi's skill, her true genius lies in her ability to empower mythic-heroic female subjects with "female artistic intelligence." In her novel, based on Gentileschi's life, Banti attempts to understand her own world, that of World War II Italy, through an imaginative and spiritual friendship with the 17th-century painter. Weaving back and forth between past and present, between a violated Artemesia and a violated Italy, Banti re-creates characters and landscapes. Through mastery of style and material, she builds a portrayal of courage and sorrow and creates a protagonist who moves from shadow to light. In both works, the final illumination belongs to the reader.<br><i>- Lucy Breslin, Portland, Me.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc."[This book] is doubly welcome, both for its hitherto underrehearsed subject--one of the most accomplished female practitioners in the history of art--and for the exceptionally keen and questing intelligence which the author brings to her task."<b>---John Gash, <i>Art in America</i></b><br><br>"If you read only one art history book this year, it should be Mary D.

So it was a shock when he told me he wanted to meet for lunch, just the two of us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Are you sure you have the right number? I texted back to him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don&#x2019;t be a dick. Just show up, he replied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The scary thing was, as much as I was trying to deny it, I knew why he wanted to meet, and what he wanted to talk about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t right about me, but he was right that there was a problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had been a hard year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not at the start. The start had me clutching for such plebeian terms as awesome! and super! Because Christmas and the new year brought me something other than the usual consumerism and post-consumerism depression. The start of this year brought me Lily&#x2014;bright, believing Lily. She was enough to get me to give credence to the notion of a benevolent fat guy in a red suit and a turbo-jacked sled. She was enough to make me feel cheer when Father Time turned over the keys to a newborn and said, Here, drive this. She was enough to turn me a little cynical about my own cynicism. We started the year making out in the rare-book room of the Strand, our favorite bookstore. It appeared to be an augur of good things to come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And it was. For a time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She met my friends. It went well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I met many members of her seemingly infinite family. It went passably.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She met my parents and stepparents. They were confused by how their dark cloud of a son could have brought home such a sunbeam. But they weren&#x2019;t complaining. They were, in fact, a little in awe, to a degree that New Yorkers usually reserve for the perfect bagel, a fifty-block cab ride with no red light, and the one movie out of every five that Woody Allen aces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I met her beloved grandpa. He liked my handshake, and said that was all he really needed to know about me in order to approve. I sought more approval anyway, because this was a man whose eyes sparkled when he recounted a ball game played fifty years ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Langston, Lily&#x2019;s brother, needed more convincing. Mostly, he left us alone. I didn&#x2019;t mind. I wasn&#x2019;t dating Lily to be with her brother. I was dating Lily to be with Lily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And I was with Lily. We didn&#x2019;t go to the same school or live in the same neighborhood, so we made Manhattan our playground, gamboling through the frostbitten parks and taking refuge in Think coffee shops and every available screen at the IFC. I showed her my favorite corners of the New York Public Library. She showed me her favorite dessert at Levain . . . which was basically all of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Manhattan didn&#x2019;t mind our wanderings one bit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>January turned to February. The cold started to seep into the city&#x2019;s bones. Smiles were harder to come by. The snow that dazzled as it fell grew less and less welcome as it stayed. We wandered around in layers, unable to feel anything firsthand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Lily&#x2014;Lily didn&#x2019;t mind. Lily was mittens and hot chocolate and snow angels that lifted from the ground and danced in the air. She said she loved winter, and I wondered if there was any season she didn&#x2019;t love. I worked hard to accept her enthusiasm as genuine. My mental furnace was built for immolation, not warmth. I didn&#x2019;t understand how she could be so happy. But such was the love I had fallen into that I decided not to question it, and to live within it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two days before her birthday, in May, I was asking my best friend, Boomer, for help in knitting her a red sweater. I was discovering that no matter how many YouTube videos you watch, there is no way to knit a red sweater in a single afternoon. The phone rang and I didn&#x2019;t hear it. Then the phone rang and my hands were occupied. It wasn&#x2019;t until two hours later that I saw how many messages I had.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Only when I listened did I learn that her beloved grandpa had suffered a minor heart attack with particularly bad timing, striking as it did while he was walking up the stairs to their apartment. He fell. And fell. And lay there for at least a half hour, barely conscious, until Lily got home and found him. The ambulance took a decade of minutes to get there. As she watched, he slipped under. As she watched, they revived him. As she waited, unable to watch, he teetered, until he barely landed on the right side of living.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her parents were in a foreign country. Langston was in class, where he wasn&#x2019;t allowed to look at his phone. I was too busy knitting her surprise present to notice she was calling. She was alone in the waiting room of New York&#x2013;-Presbyterian, about to lose something she&#x2019;d never even begun to consider that she&#x2019;d one day lose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Grandpa lived, but it took him a very long time to recover. He lived, but many of the steps were painful. He lived because she helped him live, and that helping took its toll. To have him die would have been awful, but to see him continually suffer, continually frustrated, was almost as bad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her parents came home. Langston offered to take time off from college. I tried to be there. But this was hers. Grandpa was her responsibility; she wouldn&#x2019;t have it any other way. And he was in too much pain to argue. I couldn&#x2019;t even say I blamed him&#x2014;of any of us, she&#x2019;s the one I&#x2019;d want to be the one to help me walk again. She&#x2019;s the one I&#x2019;d want to lead me back into life. Even if life did not feel, to her, as full of splendor as it had before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&#x2019;s always the ones who believe who are hurt the most when things go wrong. She didn&#x2019;t want to talk about it, and I didn&#x2019;t have the vocabulary to make her see it differently. She said she wanted me to be the place she escaped to, and I was flattered by that. I was supportive, but it was the passive support of a chair or a pillar, not the active support of a human being holding another human being upright. As her grandfather was in and out of hospitals for operations and complications from operations, in and out of physical therapy, she and I spent less time with each other&#x2014;less time wandering the city, less time wandering the corners of each other&#x2019;s thoughts. Exam time passed in a blink&#x2014;then came summer. She got a job as a volunteer at the rehabilitation clinic her grandfather was going to, just to be with him more, and to help other people who needed it like he did. I felt guilty because I spent the same period shuttling between vacations with my respective parents, my father trying to outdo my mother&#x2019;s Montreal trip with an ill-begotten jaunt to Paris. I wanted to yell at my father for taking me to Paris, then realized what a brat I sounded like, yelling at my father for taking me to Paris. Mostly, I wanted to be away from him, and home with Lily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Things were better with the new school year. Grandpa was walking again, was starting to shoo Lily away for her own good. I thought she&#x2019;d be relieved. She acted like she was relieved, but there was still a part of her that was afraid. But instead of questioning it, I went along, thinking if we pretended all was well, there would come a moment when it would switch the groove from being a half lie to being a more-than-half truth, and then ultimately it would be the whole truth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was easy to think that we were back to normal, with school in full swing and all of our friends around. We had plenty of good times, able to wander the city and forget the city at the same time. There were places within her I wasn&#x2019;t reaching, but there were plenty of other places I could reach. The part of her that laughed at the way certain dog owners looked like their dogs. The part of her that cried at TV shows where restaurants were brought back from the brink of being condemned. The part of her that kept a bag of vegan marshmallows in her room for whenever I came over, just because I once told her how much I liked them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was only when Christmas came closer that the cracks began to show.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It used to be that the Christmas season would shrink my heart to the size and substance of a gift card. I hated the way the streets would clog with a thrombosis of tourists, and how the normal thrum of the city would be drowned out by tinny clichï¿½ sentiments. Most people counted down the days till Christmas in order to get their shopping done; I counted them down in order to get Christmas over with, and for the bleaker, more genuine winter to begin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There&#x2019;d been no room in my toy-soldier heart for Lily, but she&#x2019;d forced herself in anyway. And she&#x2019;d brought Christmas with her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, don&#x2019;t get me wrong&#x2014;it still struck me as pretty bogus to pay lip service to generosity at the end of every year only to go all generosity amnesiac once the calendar page turned. The reason Lily wore it well was because she wore her kindness all year round. And now I was able to see it in other people, too&#x2014;as I sat waiting for Langston at Le Pain Quotidien, I saw this perpetual generosity in the way some of the couples looked at each other, and a lot in the way that most of the parents (even the exasperated ones) looked at their children. I saw pieces of Lily everywhere now. I&#x2019;d just seen fewer of them in Lily lately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Clearly I wasn&#x2019;t the only one, because the moment Langston sat down, he said, &#x201c;Look, the last thing I particularly want to do is break bread with you, but we&#x2019;ve got to do something, and we&#x2019;ve got to do something right away.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;There are twelve days left until Christmas, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I nodded. It was, indeed, the thirteenth of December.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, with twelve days left until Christmas, there is a big gaping hole in our apartment. You know why?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Termites?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Shut up. The reason there&#x2019;s a big gaping hole in our apartment is because we don&#x2019;t have a Christmas tree. Lily usually can&#x2019;t wait until Thanksgiving leftovers are through before running out and getting a tree&#x2014;she feels that in this city, all the good ones are taken early, and the longer you wait, the more likely you are to get a tree that isn&#x2019;t worthy of Christmas. So the tree is up before the first of December, and then she spends the next two weeks decorating. On the fourteenth, our family has a big tree-lighting ceremony&#x2014;Lily acts like it&#x2019;s an age-old family tradition, but the truth is, she started it when she was seven years old, and now it just feels like an age-old family tradition. Only, this year&#x2014;nothing. No tree. All the decorations are still in boxes. And the tree lighting is supposed to be tomorrow. Mrs. Basil E. has already ordered the catering&#x2014;and I don&#x2019;t know how to tell her that there isn&#x2019;t a tree to light.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I understood his fear. The minute their great-aunt&#x2014;who we all called Mrs. Basil E.&#x2014;opened the door to their apartment, she&#x2019;d be able to smell the lack of a tree, and would not hide her displeasure at the breach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So why don&#x2019;t you just get a tree?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Langston actually smacked his forehead in amazement at my daftness. &#x201c;Because that&#x2019;s Lily&#x2019;s job! That&#x2019;s what Lily loves to do! And if we get it without her, it&#x2019;s like we&#x2019;re pointing out that she hasn&#x2019;t done it, and that will only make her feel worse.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;True true true,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The waitress came, and we ordered pastries&#x2014;I think we both knew we didn&#x2019;t have enough conversation within us to sustain a proper meal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once we&#x2019;d ordered, I continued. &#x201c;Have you asked her about the tree? I mean, about getting one?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I tried,&#x201d; Langston said. &#x201c;Point blank&#x2014;&#x2018;Hey, why don&#x2019;t we get a tree?&#x2019; And do you know what her response was? &#x2018;I&#x2019;m just not feeling it right now.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t sound like Lily at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I know! So I figured desperate times called for desperate measures. Which is why I texted you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;But what can I do?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Has she talked to you about it at all?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even in our conversational dï¿½tente, I didn&#x2019;t want Langston to know the whole truth&#x2014;that Lily and I hadn&#x2019;t talked about very much in the weeks since Thanksgiving. Every now and then we&#x2019;d go to a museum or get dinner. Every now and then we&#x2019;d kiss, or lightly make out&#x2014;but nothing that would be out of place on CBS. Ostensibly, we were still dating. But the dating was feeling rather ostensible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t tell this to Langston because I was embarrassed that I&#x2019;d let it happen. And I didn&#x2019;t tell this to Langston because I was worried it would alarm him. My own alarms were the ones that should&#x2019;ve been going off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So instead of getting into it, I said, &#x201c;No, we haven&#x2019;t talked about the tree.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And she didn&#x2019;t invite you to the tree-lighting ceremony?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I shook my head. &#x201c;This is the first I&#x2019;m hearing of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought so. I think the only people who are planning to come are the family members who come every year. Usually Lily hands out invitations. But I guess she just wasn&#x2019;t feeling that, either.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Clearly, we have to do something.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but what? It really feels like it would be a betrayal if I went out and bought a tree.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I thought about it for a moment, and something came to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;But what if there&#x2019;s a loophole?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Langston cocked his head, looked at me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m listening.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What if I got her the tree? As a present. Part of my Christmas present to her. She doesn&#x2019;t know that I know about your family tradition. I could just bluster and bluff my way into it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Langston didn&#x2019;t want to like the idea, because it would mean liking me, at least for a minute. But his eyes kicked in with a gleam that, for a moment, countered his doubt.</p></p><h2>Tribes of Redwall: Badgers</h2><p><b>The Tribes of Redwall</b> series takes an exciting new look at the wealth of clans-the badgers, the moles, the shrews-that make up the legendary life of Brian Jacques' best-selling series.

In<i> The Season of Migration</i>, Nellie Hermann conjures this period in a profoundly imaginative, original, and heartbreaking vision of Van Gogh's early years, before he became the artist we know today.<br> In December 1878, Vincent van Gogh arrives in the coal-mining village of Petit Wasmes in the Borinage region of Belgium, a blasted and hopeless landscape of hovels and slag heaps and mining machinery. Not yet the artist he is destined to become, Vincent arrives as an ersatz preacher, barely sanctioned by church authorities but ordained in his own mind and heart by a desperate and mistaken spiritual vocation. But what Vincent experiences in the Borinage will change him. Coming to preach a useless gospel he thought he knew and believed, he learns about love, suffering, and beauty, ultimately coming to see the world anew and finding the divine not in religion but in our fallen human world.<br> In startlingly beautiful and powerful language, Hermann transforms our understanding of Van Gogh and the redemptive power of art.</p></p><p><b>Nellie Hermann</b> was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and lives in Brooklyn, New York. Her first novel, <i>The Cure for Grief, </i>was published in 2008. She teaches creative writing at Columbia University and has taught and lectured widely on the use of creativity in nontraditional contexts.<p>&#x201c;...[H]ere I realized that <i>The Season of Migration</i> is best apprehended not as a conventional novel but as a portrait of a crisis. John Berger observed that van Gogh's extraordinary openness allowed him to become permeated by--or to leave himself and permeate--whatever he saw. At her frequent best, Nellie Hermann achieves a smiliar feat of communion. Her searching empathy and exacting passion accrue as brush strokes on a canvas, until at last we may stand back, perceive the whole and let it enter us.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Leah Hager Cohen, New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;In <i>The Season of Migration</i> [Hermann] assumes Van Gogh's voice and point of view so vividly that readers want to believe that she has captured the painter's actual experience.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Rosemary Herbert, Star Tribune</i></p><p>&#x201c;...[A] historical novel as successful as this one--both in scope and in the beauty of its language--reminds us that literature can do anything, and leaves us in awe of the author's ambition. We have a language here that in its beauty does justice to van Gogh's own brilliance; and in its structure, justice to the tumult of the painter's troubled, violent life.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jake Zucker, Electric Literature</i></p><p>&#x201c;[S]omberly engrossing... <i>The Season of Migration</i> is a risk-taking hybrid, part epistolary impersonation, part act of biographical second-guessing.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jan Stuart, Boston Globe</i></p><p>&#x201c;Masterful work of historical fiction.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Vivid imagery skillfully evokes Van Gogh's paintings... Subtle and winding, but deeply felt, the novel succeeds as an origin story of a particular creative genius.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;In <i>The Season of Migration</i>, Nellie Hermann has constructed a spectacular portrait of an artist simultaneously alienated from and in love with the world. Hermann's Van Gogh is extraordinary--as luminous and intense and strange in these pages as in any of his self-portraits. But the miracle of Hermann's writing is to make him ordinary at the same time. His struggle to live in a world terrorized by loss and the threat of loss is everybody's struggle, and as pain in life teaches him slowly to see, we learn to do it as well. By the end of the story, Van Gogh, debilitated and exalted, knows what beauty is. The reader lucky enough to encounter this book will know it, too.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Chris Adrian, author of The Children's Hospital</i></p><p>&#x201c;Fans of Nellie Hermann's<i> The Cure for Grief</i> already know that she is our expert chronicler of the complex love between siblings; in <i>The Season of Migration</i>, she channels the story of Vincent van Gogh, Theo van Gogh, and the ghost of their dead brother. Hermann writes beautifully about the wrenching pain of disenchantment, as well as its joyful transubstantiation into art .Every scene is a color-saturated dream, every detail lived and felt. Hermann has done something miraculous here.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Karen Russell, author of Swamplandia! and Vampires in the Lemon Grove</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Season of Migration</i> is a masterpiece; it blew me away. A triumph of lyrical intensity, resonance of voice, psychological acuity, Nellie Hermann's novel has shed new light on the Van Gogh few people have known. Heartbreaking and beautiful.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Mary Gordon, author of The Liar's Wife</i></p><p>&#x201c;Although we may know Vincent Van Gogh's work, and perhaps the broad strokes of his biography, Nellie Hermann's extraordinary accomplishment in <i>The Season of Migration</i> is to reveal him to us before he knows himself. Still years away from The Potato Eaters, Van Gogh as Hermann has brought him to life is aimless, wrecked, yet driven by the hope of finding communion with the lives he encounters. In language as moving as the work of the artist she renders, Hermann captures in vivid detail that critical period in Van Gogh's life when, at his lowest point, he begins to find that connection through his art. When his artist's eye finds flashes of beauty despite the grimmest of circumstances, the reader's heart will sing.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Mary Beth Keane, author of Fever</i></p><p>&#x201c;Hermann follows up her well-received debut (<i>The Cure for Grief</i>, 2008) with a sensitive novel about a crucial turning point in the life of Vincent van Gogh... [She] quietly shows van Gogh drawing compulsively as he trudges miserably through the countryside, poor, sick and starving but always looking with wonder at the world around him. ...We know, although Vincent does not, that he is on the road to achieving the apotheosis he spoke of in happier times with Theo: "the way an artist could succeed at portraying a feeling in an image...translate not just the beauty of it but the exact joy that we felt." Finely wrought fiction eschewing the usual clichï¿½s about artistic inspiration in favor of deeper, more organic understanding.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><h2>Problems and Materials on Secured Transactions 9e</h2><p>Secured Transactions Textbook.

One in six new houses today is a prefab and 400,000 units are now produced in the U.S. each year. More than 50% of all homes are constructed in whole or in part by using building systems -- modular, panelized components produced in quality controlled environments. This exploration of the best prefabricated houses on the market today, from all over the world, along with a resource directory on how you can purchase them, is an invaluable reference for those interested in this alternative.</p></p><p>Jill Herbers has written various articles on architecture and interior design for dozens of publications, including <i>House Beautiful, Home, Metropolis, The New Yorker,</i> and <i>ID.</i> She also writes a Universal Press Syndicate column appearing in over 200 newspapers, and is the author of several previous books, including the best-seller <i>Tile.</i> Jill lives in Princeton, NJ.Who says dream houses are only for the rich? The ongoing revolution in prefabricated homes brings innovative, contemporary design to the masses, transforming "trailer trash to trailer chic," declares architectural writer Herbers. These diverse projects by 15 firms-from Michael Graves&#x2019;s Pavilions (designed for Target as freestanding structures or home additions) to Rocio Romero&#x2019;s LV Home building kit-are not only inexpensive, they&#x2019;re also sturdy, transportable, adaptable and, most revolutionary of all, purchasable online. Much of the secret to cutting costs is using readily available materials such as steel, glass and aluminum, and cutting the building process down to a few days. As a result, several bargain homes featured sell for well under $100,000 and can be assembled by the owner-like Romero&#x2019;s rustic Fish Camp House for $30,000, including furnishings, or Adam Kalkin&#x2019;s Quik Build House for $50,000. Glossy photographs highlight these sleek, functional spaces, and pages are enriched by detailed house plans and Herbers&#x2019; anecdotal narration of their genesis. The blond wood floors and window-lined bookshelves in Oskar Leo Kaufman&#x2019;s signature SU-SI House, for example, were originally designed for his sister Suzy and offer a clean, minimalist feel along with plenty of light and storage. Herbers situates the projects within a brief history of modern prefab and muses on the future of the movement. Most important, she aims to make this architectural spectacle as functional as the designs it features by including a final section on "Constructing Prefab," with advice on new materials and processes, building guidelines and a list of material sources. Like prefab modern itself, this book successfully combines both style and practicality. 100 color photographs.<br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Unlike any earlier films, Godard's work shifts fluidly from fiction to documentary, from criticism to art. The man himself also projects shifting images&#x2015;cultural hero, fierce loner, shrewd businessman. Hailed by filmmakers as a&#x2015;if not the&#x2015;key influence on cinema, Godard has entered the modern canon, a figure as mysterious as he is indispensable. </p><p>In <i>Everything Is Cinema</i>, critic Richard Brody has amassed hundreds of interviews to demystify the elusive director and his work. Paying as much attention to Godard's technical inventions as to the political forces of the postwar world, Brody traces an arc from the director's early critical writing, through his popular success with Breathless, to the grand vision of his later years. He vividly depicts Godard's wealthy conservative family, his fluid politics, and his tumultuous dealings with women and fellow New Wave filmmakers. </p><p><i>Everything Is Cinema</i> confirms Godard's greatness and shows decisively that his films have left their mark on screens everywhere.</p></p><p><p><b>Richard Brody</b> is a film critic and editor at <i>The New Yorker</i>. <i>Everything Is Cinema</i> is his first book.</p>Chapter One<br>"WE DO NOT THINK, WE ARE THOUGHT" <p></p>IN THE SECOND EDITION, DATED JUNE 1950, of A THIN newspaper-like magazine published in Paris, La Gazette du cinï¿½ma, a nineteen-year-old writer made a modest debut. Jean-Luc Godard&#x2019;s article, simply titled "Joseph Mankiewicz," was a short and breezy overview of that director&#x2019;s career, though, as in the following reference to the director&#x2019;s recent film, A Letter to Three Wives, it was devoted less to his films than to Mankiewicz himself: " &#x2018;One can judge a woman&#x2019;s past by her present,&#x2019; Mankiewicz says somewhere: this letter to three married women is also three letters to the same woman, one whom the director probably loved." <p></p>In an eight-paragraph jaunt, the young writer lightly sketched a conception of the cinema that was as intensely personal as it was revolutionary: he suggested that films are one with the world offscreen. Casually, and without any theoretical fuss, he treated films as something more than creations that bore the mark of their makers; he considered them inseparable from the lives of their creators. <p></p>Godard&#x2019;s piece on the front page of the next issue of La Gazette, "For a Political Cinema," is as provocative now as it seemed at the time. In it, he put forth an aesthetic framework that daringly overrode basic ideological distinctions in the name of specifically cinematic values. <p></p>One afternoon, at the end of the Gaumont newsreel, we opened our eyes wide with pleasure: young German Communists were marching in a May Day celebration. Suddenly, space was only the lines of lips and bodies, time only the raising of fists in the air...By the sole force of propaganda that was animating them, these young people were beautiful.1 <p></p>Godard compared these young people to St. Sebastian and to the youths in classical Greek sculpture: the state of possession, albeit an intellectual one, that resulted from the thrall of ideology seemed to him to resemble religious devotion and thus to confer on its subject a transcendent serenity. He added that in Soviet films, "the actor infallibly returns to what he originally was, a priest. The Fall of Berlin and The Battle of Stalingrad are coronation masses." Godard treated expressions of Communist and Christian faith as equivalent, and admired the similar power of Nazi propaganda films, which had so recently been pressed upon Parisian moviegoers by German occupiers: <p></p>We could not forget Hitler Youth Quex, certain passages of films by Leni Riefenstahl, several shocking newsreels from the Occupation, the maleficent ugliness of The Eternal Jew. It is not the first time that art is born of constraint. <p></p>Godard praised these films not for their political message but for their psychology: they depicted people under the influence, and it hardly mattered whether that influence was political or religious. He took all fanaticisms to be alike and to be equally beautiful. Without equating the far left and the far right politically, Godard equated them aesthetically. <p></p>The essay ends with an exhortation: "French filmmakers in search of scripts, how have you unfortunate souls not yet filmed the assessment of taxes, the death of Philippe Henriod [sic], the wonderful life of Danielle Casanova?" Henriot, the Minister of Information in the Vichy government and a frequent and familiar orator on French radio under occupation, was killed in 1944 by Resistance fighters. Casanova, the founder of a Communist youth newspaper in the 1930s, was a Resistance fighter who died at Auschwitz. Godard endorsed as equally cinematically fertile the actions of a collaborator, of a resister, and ordinary parliamentary infighters, and he took the adventures and anecdotes that arose in the course of contemporary and recent history to be the cinema&#x2019;s natural subject. The passions to which the characters in such films would bear witness were those that belonged to the real world, as verified by the reality from which they derived. The cinematic fictions that the young Godard dreamed of arose from the documentary impulse. <p></p>Moreover, his idealistic depiction of the young fanatic was a touching, if oblique, self-portrait. He was leading a life of singular and exalted purpose: his monomaniacal fervor was ignited by movies, and he gave remarkably definitive expression to it in the following issue of La Gazette. <p></p>The October 1950 edition featured a brief note by "H.L."&#x2014;Hans Lucas, "Jean-Luc" in German, a pseudonym that Godard occasionally adopted through 1955&#x2014;on a documentary film about Alexander Calder&#x2019;s mobiles. One mercurial sentence sums up with a self-revealing clarity the adolescent Godard&#x2019;s relation to the cinema: "At the cinema, we do not think, we are thought."2 This observation was less an avowal of passivity than of the will to self-transformation through movies. It indicates Godard&#x2019;s consuming submission to cinema and the extent to which he experienced it as a personal epiphany, indeed a transfiguration. Godard had reached the essence of the experience at once, and conveyed it in an unabashed confession. In a single aphorism, he broke down the barriers of aesthetic distance and contemplation that separate the cinema, its viewers, and its makers. At the earliest stage of his work, Godard&#x2019;s existence and that of the cinema were already fused. <p></p>These three articles delineate a coherent and comprehensive cinematic philosophy, one which Godard would realize and rework in a wide variety of forms in a filmmaking career that began in 1954 and continues to this day. The ideas that they sketch are the unity of the filmmaker with the film, the inseparability of both from the social world at large, the credence of a devout moviegoer in the reality of the world as presented in the cinema, and the aesthetic fecundity of this fanatical submission. The viewer who was "thought" at the cinema was Godard himself; the filmmaker who was one with his film would be Godard himself; and his films would be the seemingly infinite variations on the theme of his singular faith in the cinema and in its ability to preserve and to reflect both the reality of the filmmaker and of his times through the intersection of personal stories and political history. <p></p>But each of these principles came with a price tag. Godard&#x2019;s submission to the cinema risked alienation from life. Films conceived as the expression of fanatical devotion to the cinema risked becoming a closed circuit of self-satisfied self-reference to the exclusion of reality. The identification of the film and the filmmaker risked the creation of a cult of personality that would detract attention from the filmmaker&#x2019;s work. And the avidly omnivorous, ideologically indeterminate recording of political currents ran the risk of detachment and ambiguity. Over time, Godard would recognize all of these risks and, in his work and his life, would attempt to confront and to overcome them. <p></p>THE STORY OF Jean-Luc Godard&#x2019;s work is one of a conversion to the secular religion of art and, specifically, to the art of cinema. For this art form, for this sort of passion, the holy city was, and remains, Paris. <p></p>The movies started in France, with the work of the Lumiï¿½re brothers,3 and the special relationship of Paris to the movies is in large part due to that city&#x2019;s central role in French civilization. For France, Paris is three things in one: it is the country&#x2019;s New York, Washington, D.C., and Hollywood&#x2014;the cultural, political, and cinematic capital. The three domains are much more strongly interconnected in France than in the United States, and activity in any one of the three fields is quickly reflected in the other two. As a result, in France the movie business has also been, all along, both a strain of high art and a sensitive political barometer. <p></p>French filmmakers participated in, and often emerged from, literary circles, and Parisian artists took a serious interest in the movies almost from their inception. It was the French critic Ricciotto Canudo who called the cinema the "sixth art" in a 1911 essay (and the "seventh art" in 1919). Charlie Chaplin and D. W. Griffith were French cultural heroes as early as 1916, and artists of all sorts, especially the surrealists, took the cinema very seriously. Jean Cocteau made a film in 1930; Salvador Dali collaborated with Luis Buï¿½uel on Un Chien andalou and L&#x2019;Age d&#x2019;or; the film director Sacha Guitry was first a famous playwright; the greatest French prewar filmmaker, Jean Renoir, who made his first film in 1925, was the son of Auguste Renoir, the artist. Unlike American writers, for whom working on movies usually meant going to Hollywood and setting literature aside, such French writers as Cocteau, Jean-Paul Sartre, Andrï¿½ Malraux, Jean Giraudoux, and Jacques Prï¿½vert were active in the cinema without having to distance themselves, geographically or practically, from the literary scene. <p></p>Postwar Paris was teeming with movies, especially American movies. Having been deprived of Hollywood productions under the German occupation, moviegoers were hungry to see those that had been made during World War II as well as the latest ones, and they flooded the screens. These films too were taken seriously, and nowhere more so than in a magazine called La Revue du cinï¿½ma, which was published by France&#x2019;s most prestigious literary publisher, Gallimard. When the fifteen-year-old Jean-Luc Godard came to Paris in 1946 to attend the prestigious Lycï¿½e Buffon, he entered a lively and burgeoning cinematic scene, one that was energized both by the quantity of films available and by the quality of thought in circulation regarding the "seventh art." It was enriched by contact with the literary, artistic, and intellectual elite that embraced it, and was riven by political controversies that mirrored the political divisions of postwar France&#x2014;some of which were aroused by the cinema itself. <p></p>GODARD WAS BORN ON DECEMBER 3, 1930, in the elegant seventh arrondissement of Paris. His father, Paul Godard, a doctor, moved the family to Switzerland four years later. His mother, Odile, nï¿½e Monod, was the daughter of one of the most prominent bankers in France, Julien Monod, a founder of the Banque Paribas. Monod was also an extremely literate man, a close friend of the writer Paul Valï¿½ry and, after Valï¿½ry&#x2019;s death in 1945, his literary executor. <p></p>Family documents include a letter that Valï¿½ry wrote to Odile Monod in April 1928, on the occasion of her engagement to Paul Godard. She was eighteen years old at the time; her fiancï¿½ was twenty-seven. Her parents opposed the marriage; Paul Godard, though Protestant like the Monods, was not of their social station. Nonetheless, the couple married in 1928. They settled temporarily in Paris, and their first child, Rachel, was born on January 1, 1930. (Valï¿½ry&#x2019;s letter to the newborn, dated January 6, 1930, is published in the collection Lettres ï¿½ quelques-uns.) Godard also has two younger siblings, a brother, Claude, born in 1933, and a sister, Vï¿½ronique, born in 1937. <p></p>The most comprehensive research on the subject of Godard&#x2019;s family and youth has been done by Colin MacCabe, who was, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Godard&#x2019;s authorized biographer; the results of his research were published in 2003, in his Portrait of the Artist at Seventy.4 Paul Godard worked at a private medical clinic, La Ligniï¿½re, near Gland, on the shore of Lake Geneva, between Geneva and Lausanne, and ultimately opened a clinic of his own, near Lausanne. Broken plaster in a wall there was said in family lore to have been made by young Jean-Luc&#x2019;s head during a transport of rage. To see a photograph of the wall is to fear for any child whose head might have done it.5 His mother wrote of the toddler Godard&#x2019;s furious temper, calling him a grand ï¿½clabousseur (a great spatterer).6 <p></p>The family was prosperous and cultured. Reading aloud from literature was a common form of domestic entertainment and ritual. Godard&#x2019;s grandfather, Julien Monod, enforced humanistic rules, including the requirement that youngsters recite literature at the dinner table. Each year, on his maternal grandparents&#x2019; wedding anniversary, young Jean-Luc was expected to recite Valï¿½ry&#x2019;s poem "Le Cimetiï¿½re marin" (The Seaside Cemetery).7 (Moreover, Godard recalled receiving Latin lessons from Valï¿½ry.) 8 Religion was part of the family&#x2019;s cultural heritage as well, and Godard recalled attending Protestant "temple" regularly though without doctrinaire devotion: he considered it a casual habit ("I went, the same way I played soccer or did gymnastics") 9 and, with his grandfather Monod, debated the minister&#x2019;s sermons. <p></p>When World War II started, nine-year-old Jean-Luc Godard was in Brittany on vacation with relatives, and it was only with some difficulty that he could return to Switzerland. Godard spent most of the war in Switzerland, though he and members of his family habitually crossed Lake Geneva in a small boat to make clandestine visits to their grandfather&#x2019;s estate on the French side of the lake. <p></p>During the war, Godard&#x2019;s parents worked with the Red Cross and, Godard came to believe, had knowledge of the concentration camps established by Nazi Germany. MacCabe emphasizes the pro-English sympathies of Paul Godard (who had studied in London and, during the war, sheltered an English prisoner of war), yet Godard often spoke instead of his father&#x2019;s pro-German sympathies, and, following his family&#x2019;s lead, he was rooting for the Germans. He followed the course of the war on a map, with pins representing the movement of the opposing armies as reported in newspapers; he cheered on the advances of the German army and lamented its reversals, and later recalled, "When Rommel lost at El Alamein, I was deeply affected, a little as if my favorite soccer team had lost a game." <p></p>Godard&#x2019;s maternal grandparents were supporters of Vichy. Godard later described his maternal grandfather as "anti-Jew" and an "anti-Semite," and remembered hearing Julien Monod refer to his doctor as a youpin (kike).10 At home, the family listened to Vichy-run radio, where Jean-Luc grew accustomed to the rhetoric of pro-German politicians and commentators and remembered, decades later, the rapt attention when speeches by Philippe Henriot were broadcast. The days of Henriot&#x2019;s assassination (in 1944) and of the execution of Robert Brasillach, the right-wing critic and novelist and anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi propagandist (in 1945), were days of mourning in the Godard house.11 <p></p>Godard recalled spending about a year and a half, from the ages of twelve and thirteen, in wartime Vichy, where his maternal grandfather "knew some people." Godard recalled that he always had an "affinity" for Julien Monod, whose sympathies were clearly suggested by the reading that he shared with his grandson Jean-Luc, as Godard later recalled: "I read Les Dï¿½combres, by Lucien Rebatet, because my grandfather was ultra-literary ...At night, we read aloud. We read Rebatet&#x2019;s novel."12 Rebatet, who was convicted of collaboration in 1946 and spent six years in prison, was a vehement anti-Semite and actively endorsed France&#x2019;s pro-Nazi regime. Les Dï¿½combres (The Ruins), his lengthy screed about the decline of France&#x2014;in his view, due largely to French Jewry and reversible by collaboration with Germany&#x2014;was said to be "for the little Parisian collaborationist world, the great politico-literary event of 1942." 13 <p></p>The young Godard was an eager reader; his preferred fare was the children&#x2019;s adventure novel, such as Le Voyage d&#x2019;Edgar, by Edouard Peisson, whose work was popular at the time.

In the telling, bizarre ancestors reveal themselves, delightful and bitter childhood memories surface, enthralling anecdotes of youthful years are narrated and intimate secrets are softly whispered. </p> <p> In an exorcism of death and a celebration of life, Isabel Allende explores the past, questions the gods, and creates a magical book that carries the reader from tears to laughter, from terror to sensuality to wisdom. In <i>Paula,</i> readers will come to understand that the miraculous world of her novels is the world Isabel Allende inhabits -- it is her enchanted reality. </p></p><p>"Listen, Paula. I am going to tell you a story so that when you wake up you will not feel so lost." So says Chilean writer Isabel Allende (<i>The House of the Spirits</i>) in the opening lines of the luminous, heart-rending memoir she wrote while her 28-year-old daughter Paula lay in a coma. In its pages, she ushers an assortment of outrageous relatives into the light: her stepfather, an amiable liar and tireless debater; grandmother Meme, blessed with second sight; and delinquent uncles who exultantly torment Allende and her brothers. Irony and marvelous flights of fantasy mix with the icy reality of Paula's deathly illness as Allende sketches childhood scenes in Chile and Lebanon; her uncle Salvatore Allende's reign and ruin as Chilean president; her struggles to shake off or find love; and her metamorphosis into a writer.One of the most popular and acclaimed Latin American authors of our century presents this unforgettable memoir, an exquisitely rendered, deeply moving mother-daughter story that doubles as her autobiography. <p><i>Paula </i>is a soul-baring memoir one reads without drawing a breath, like a novel of suspense. The point of departure for these moving pages is a tragic personal experience. In December 1991, Isabel Allende's daughter, Paula, became gravely ill and shortly thereafter fell into a coma. During hours in the hospital, the author began to write the story of her family for her unconscious daughter. In the telling, bizarre ancestors appear before our eyes, and we hear both delightful and bitter childhood memories, amazing anecdotes of youthful years, the most intimate secrets passed along in whispers. Chile, Allende's native land, comes alive as well, with the turbulent history of the military coup of 1973, the following dictatorship and her family's years of exile. </p><p>As an exorcism of death, in these pages Isabel Allende explores the past and questions the gods. The result is a magical book that carries the reader from tears to laughter, from terror to sensuality and wisdom. <i>Paula</i> is a prodigious evocation and a hymn to life, written from the heart of the courageous and estimable woman who created <i>The House of the Spirits</i>.</p></p><h2>The Jungle Books (Borders Classics Series)</h2><p>PLEASE NOTE: Currently we&#39;re in the process of updating Description, Photos, etc. of many of our listings, and apologize for any lack of information on these items.

For more than two years, a panel composed of such arbiters of culture as Leo Castelli, Rita Dove, Bruce Jenner, Joyce Carol Oates, Daniel Schorr, Gay Talese, Pierre Trudeau, and Eli Wallach pondered that question and came up with a list of the 200 most important icons of the 20th century. Their choices are compiled in this wonderfully designed book. Each icon merits a tall, vertically oriented, two-page spread. A full-page portrait is expertly reproduced on the right-hand side, and, given its length, a surprisingly informative biography takes up the facing page. Uncommon photos of the usual suspects are here--Marilyn Monroe, Martin Luther King Jr., James Joyce, Babe Ruth, Bette Davis, Jesse Owens, Marlon Brando, JFK, Anna Pavlova, even Michael Jordan. But some of the most pleasing inclusions are the surprises--the people who shaped the century but whose faces are less recognizable. This group includes philosophers Hannah Arendt and Carl Jung; South African doctor Christiann Barnard, who performed the first successful human heart transplant surgery; scientist Enrico Fermi, whose work led directly to the discovery of nuclear fission; Maria Montessori, who revolutionized early childhood education; legendary conductor Arturo Toscanini; and James Watson and Francis Crick, who discovered the shape of DNA. This is a well-timed book, for as the century draws to a close, one can hardly think of a better way to take stock of the dramatic events, advances, and--arguably--declines that have shaped the human experience over the past 100 years.Barbara Cady, writer, editor, and publisher, began her career in journalism as a book reviewer for The Los Angeles Times.

Stranger still, it seems to have the same face as the narrator. Made into a film in 1920, this extraordinary book combines uncanny psychology of doppelganger stories with expressionism and more than a little melodrama... Meyrink&#39;s old Prague - like Dicken&#39;s London - is one of the great creations of City writing, an eerie, claustrophobic and fantastical underworld where anything can happen.&#34; -- Phil Baker in The Sunday Times</p><p>Gustav Meyrink (I868-1932) found worldwide critical and commercial acclaim with his first novel The Golem (I9I5), which prior to the Dedalus Meyrink programme has been the only work available in English. It established his reputation as the master of the occult and the grotesque.(He was the German translator of Dickens). His reputation declined in his last years but his work is now being reassessed in Germany &amp; Austria, and he is now considered as one of the most important German language novelists of the 20th century . Dedalus is part of the European-wide movement championing Meyrink's work. A new translation of The Golem was published by Dedalus in 1995, and the first English translations of The Green Face; Walpurgisnacht, The Angel of the West Window, The White Dominican, The Opal (and other stories), were published by Dedalus during 1991-94 making all of Meyrink's major work available in English. In 2008 Dedalus published the first English language biography of Gustav Meyrink,Vivo: The Life of Gustav Meyrink by Mike Michell. In 2010 Dedalus will publish a further collection of Meyrink's short stories.'A remarkable work of horror, half- way between Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Frankenstein.'The Observer<br><br>'Gustav Meyrink uses this legend in a dream-like setting on the Other Side of the Mirror and he has invested it with a horror so palpable that it has remained in my memory all these years.'

Drawing on the discourses of philosophy and animal training, Vicki Hearne makes a case, in boldly anthromorphic terms, for attributing to the creatures we love, train, and play with, the potential for a &#34;moral understanding&#34; of their relationship to us--the potential, in other words, for nobility and dignity. With a new introduction by Donald McCaig.<i>Adam's Task</i> offers an innovative and metaphysical approach to training animals. Based on studies of literary criticism, philosophy, and extensive hands-on experience in training, Hearne asserts that animals (at least those that commonly cohabitate or interact with humans) are far more intelligent than we assume. In fact, they are capable of developing an understanding of "the good," a moral code that influences their motives and actions. In response to her studies and experiments, Hearne developed an entirely new system of animal training that contradicts modern animal behavioral research and yet, as her examples show, is astonishingly effective.</p><h2>Built to Sell: Turn Your Business Into One You Can Sell</h2><p>When you start a business, it&#x2019;s natural to dream of selling it one day.

Quite nice, actually; the duke could not help but wonder what salacious little act the resident had performed to earn a house of this quality. </p><p> He stepped up to the door, lifted the brass knocker, rapped three times, and waited impatiently. He was in a very cross mood to be sure. He'd never been so exploited, so ill-used -- </p><p> The door swung open and a gentleman of average height with a flat nose, a shock of ginger hair, and wearing a rumpled suit of clothing stood before him. He looked the duke directly in the eye and offered no greeting. </p><p> "The Duke of Darlington," the duke announced gruffly as he reached into his coat pocket and withdrew a calling card. "I have come to call on Miss Bergeron. She is expecting me." </p><p> The man held out a silver tray. Darlington tossed his card onto it. "I'll tell her," the man said, and moved to shut the door. </p><p> But Darlington had been vexed beyond all civility; he quickly threw up a hand and blocked the door. "I'll wait inside, if you please." </p><p> The man's impassive expression didn't change. He shoved the door shut, leaving Darlington standing on the stoop. </p><p> "Bloody outrageous," Darlington muttered, and glanced up the street. In spite of the snow, people had set out to various holiday gatherings. He himself was expected a half hour ago on the other side of Green Park to preside over the annual soiree held for one hundred and fifty of his family's closest friends. </p><p> The door abruptly opened, startling Darlington. The man said, "Come." </p><p> Darlington swept inside and removed his beaver hat, which he thrust at the man. "What is your name?" he demanded. </p><p> "Butler." </p><p> "I do not mean your occupation," he said shortly, "but your name." </p><p> <i>"Butler,"</i> the man responded just as shortly. "This way," he added, and carelessly tossed the duke's hat onto a console. The hat slid off the edge of the table and landed on its crown on the floor, but Butler walked on, lifting a candelabrum high to light the way. </p><p> He led Darlington up a flight of stairs, then down a corridor that was lined with paintings and expensive china vases stuffed full of hothouse flowers. The floor covering, Darlington noted, was a fine Belgian carpet. </p><p> Miss Bergeron had done very well for herself. </p><p> Butler paused before a pair of red pocket doors and knocked. A muffled woman's voice bid him enter. He looked at Darlington. "Wait," he said before entering the room, and left the doors slightly ajar. </p><p> Darlington sighed impatiently and glanced at his pocket watch again. </p><p> "Here now, darling," he heard a feminine voice say. "Tell me, how do you like this?" </p><p> <i>"Mmm,"</i> a male voice answered. </p><p> Darlington jerked his gaze to the pair of doors and stared in disbelief. </p><p> "And <i>this</i>?" she asked with a bit of a chuckle. "Do you like it?" </p><p> The response, from what the duke could gather, was a sigh of pleasure. </p><p> "Ah, but wait, for you've not lived until you've -- " </p><p> "Caller," Butler said. </p><p> "Not <i>now</i>, Kate," the male voice objected. "Please! You leave me with such a hunger for more!" </p><p> "Digby! Keep your hands away!" There was a slight pause, and then the woman said, "Oh. It's <i>him</i>. Please show him in, Aldous." </p><p> Darlington started when Butler pulled the doors wide open. He quickly glanced down, his sense of propriety making him avert his gaze from whatever lewd act he was sure he was interrupting. </p><p> "Your Grace?" </p><p> Darlington looked up. Whatever he might have expected, it was not the sight that greeted him. Yes, the room looked a bit like a French boudoir, with peachcolored walls, silken draperies, and overstuffed furnishings upholstered in floral chintz. There were gazettes, hats, and a cloak carelessly draped over a chair. But the woman inside was not lying on a daybed with a man on top of her as he'd suspected. </p><p> He was surprised to see her standing at a table piled high with pastries and sweetmeats. Moreover, there were Christmas boughs and hollies adorning the walls and the mantel, a dozen candles lit the room, and a fire was blazing in the hearth. </p><p> Her male companion, a portly fellow with thinning hair who easily weighed thirteen or fourteen stone, held nothing more lurid than a teacup. The sugary remnants of a pastry dusted his upper lip. </p><p> Darlington was stunned, first and foremost because he had supposed something entirely different was occurring in this room. But perhaps even more so because the woman, Miss Katharine Bergeron, was breathtaking. </p><p> Darlington had known this woman was unusually beautiful. He'd heard it from more than one quarter and he'd seen it with his own eyes not two nights past at the King's Opera House, when he'd attended the first London performance of Mozart's <i>La Clemenza di Tito</i> at the behest of his friend George, the Prince of Wales. He'd sat with George in the royal box, and it was George who had pointed out Katharine Bergeron. Seated two boxes away, she was in the company of Mr. Cousineau, a Frenchman who had made a respectable fortune selling luxurious fabrics to wealthy London society. Miss Bergeron was infamously his model and his mistress. </p><p> As Darlington observed her that evening, she'd leaned slightly forward in her seat, enraptured by the music. She'd worn a white silk gown trimmed in pink velvet that seemed to shimmer in the low light of the opera house. Pearls had dripped from her ears, her wrists, and more notably, her throat. Her hair, pale blond, was bound up with yet another string of pearls. She did not wear a plume, as so many ladies seemed to prefer, but instead allowed wisps of curls to drape the nape of her long, slender neck. </p><p> She'd turned her head slightly and discovered him observing her. She did not glance away shyly, but calmly returned his gaze a long moment before turning her attention to the stage once more. </p><p> Darlington had found her boldness mildly interesting. Nevertheless, he had not anticipated seeing her again...until George had summoned him. Now, he was standing in her private salon. </p><p> But she looked nothing like she had the night at the opera. She was beautiful, astonishingly so, but now, free of cosmetic, her beauty was simpler and natural. She wore a rather plain blue gown, an apron, and a shawl wrapped demurely around her shoulders. Her hair was not dressed, but hung long and full down her back. </p><p> "Your Grace," she said again, smiling warmly. She picked up a plate of muffins. "May I entice you with a Christmas treat? I just made them," she added proudly. </p><p> "They are divine, Your Grace," the portly man said, coming to his feet and bowing his head. </p><p> <i>"No,"</i> Darlington said incredulously. Did they think he'd come for tea? "A word, madam?" </p><p> "Of course," she said, and handed the plate of muffins to her companion. "Please do go with Aldous, Digby, and mind you don't eat them all." </p><p> "I shall endeavor to be good," he said jovially, "but you know how wretched I can be." He patted his large belly, gave the duke another curt bow, and followed Butler out. </p><p> When they had left the room, Darlington frowned. "I regret that we've not had the courtesy of a proper introduction, but it would seem the situation does not lend itself to that." </p><p> "Yes," she said, eyeing the rest of the food on the table, "I had not expected you so soon." </p><p> "Your patron was rather insistent." </p><p> She gave him a wry look and gestured to a chair near the table. "Please do be seated. Are you certain I cannot tempt you to taste a muffin? I confess, I am learning the art of baking and I am not certain of the quality." </p><p> "No. You cannot." </p><p> "Please," she said again, gesturing to the chair. "I hope you will be at ease here." </p><p> "Miss Bergeron, I do not find the circumstances the least bit easy." </p><p> "Oh, I <i>see</i>," she said, lifting a fine brow. </p><p> He rather doubted she did. She was a courtesan, hardly accustomed to the pressures of propriety that he faced every day. "I have come as the prince has demanded to make your acquaintance and to mutually agree on a public appearance or two that will serve his...purpose," he said with distaste. </p><p> "Very well." She smiled then, and Darlington knew in that moment how she had captivated the prince. </p><p> But if she thought that he could be so easily seduced, she was very much mistaken. And pray tell, what was that just above the dimple on her cheek? A bit of flour? "There is the Carlton House Twelfth Night Ball," he said, a bit distracted by the flour. </p><p> "That would do. Shall I meet you there?" </p><p> "I will come for you." </p><p> Her smile seemed to grow even more enticing. </p><p> "There is an opera scheduled shortly thereafter. Will that suit?" </p><p> "I adore opera," she said smoothly. </p><p> "Very well," Darlington said. "That should suffice for the time being. Furthermore, may I remind you that in the course of this <i>ruse</i>," he said with an angry flick of his wrist, "I expect you to defer to me as one would defer to a peer. We are merely to be seen in public together and rely on the usual wagging tongues to do the rest. Therefore, I see no reason to touch or otherwise engage in any behavior that might be remarked upon by my esteemed family or close acquaintances.

The Thirty Years&#x2019; War engulfed Europe in brutal and chaotic conflict. Mercenary armies of competing emperors and popes, princes, dukes, and archbishops roamed Europe, pillaging towns and villages and slaughtering civilians. They destroyed food stocks and spread plague. Some regions lost more than half of their population. And even as the frenzy of all-against-all conflict gripped the continent, bloody civil war mounted in England that would end in a king&#x2019;s execution and rule by Protestant zealots. Many Europeans despaired that the Apocalypse was at hand. <br>It was in this world of violence and fear that the first, frail lamps of the Enlightenment were lit. The early philosophers witnessed the devastation, testimony to the desperate need for new thinking, for a revolution in ideas about humankind. The question was simple and stark: How could people be secure in their lives, empowered to make choices conducive to their peace and liberty and happiness? <br>But those early philosophers were scarcely secure in their own lives or free to publish their writings. Apart from the deadly hazards of war, they faced persecution for their ideas. It could come from Catholics or Protestants or, in Benedict de Spinoza&#x2019;s case, his fellow Jews. It might appear as the wrath of kings or of generals or the fury of a mob intent on lynching. Exile, freely chosen or not, could swiftly become dangerous as political winds shifted and sympathetic rulers changed their minds. The Catholic Inquisition condemned heretics like Galileo Galilei, while the church&#x2019;s <i>Index Liborum Prohibitorum</i> condemned their works. Censorship operated throughout Europe; any petty dukedom might have its own list of banned books. And it took a brave printer to publish an author whose writings had been denounced publicly as blasphemous and dangerous. The massed attacks of priests and preachers, of traditionalist academics and government officials, meant that some of the most challenging works of philosophers were suppressed or hidden and unpublished in their lifetimes. This left their ideas to the mercies of fate or to loyal, tenacious followers willing to risk their own liberties and lives to bring them to the public. <br>In its early years, for the Enlightenment to take root and thrive, its leadership and its ideas had to <i>survive</i>. <br>THE STATE OF NATURE <br>Few men of the Enlightenment were as disputatious as Britain&#x2019;s Thomas Hobbes. He provoked controversies in matters ranging from God&#x2019;s responsibility for the sins of man to fine points of Greek and Latin grammar to mathematics, including his attempt to square the circle. Like so many of the great intellectuals of the age, he was a polymath, putting his stamp on nearly all the cutting-edge issues, with an intellectual leadership characterized as much by the enemies he provoked as by the followers he won. Unlike other Enlightenment philosophers&#x2014;and here was a prime source of controversy&#x2014;Hobbes had a remarkably grim view of human nature, one that saw men plunged into a violent anarchy, redeemed only by their power to reason and thus create for themselves safety in civil society. Hobbes indirectly offered reason an exceptional tribute by suggesting it could rescue men from utterly desperate conditions. <br>Hobbes&#x2019;s difficult early years fed his combativeness, as well as his bleak view of what men were and how they lived. Born in 1588, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, he was brought up in an impoverished home ruled by his father, a poorly educated, quarrelsome curate who was given more to bouts with alcohol than churchly duties. Excommunicated after slandering another clergyman and facing new charges for brawling in a churchyard, Thomas Hobbes Sr. fled into obscurity. Happily, young Hobbes had a prosperous uncle, a glover able to put his young nephew through Oxford. Hobbes entered the university at the tender age of fourteen. <br>Shy and sickly, he had to compete with classmates two or three years older, in classes usually taught in Latin. He was no grind, absorbed more by catching jackdaws at his window than by attending dull classes, but he was presentable enough on graduation to be sought out by members of the Cavendish clan, a wealthy and powerful family with grand estates at Chatsworth and Hardwick. Hobbes was hired to tutor William Cavendish, heir to the first earl of Devonshire and only two years his junior, and he remained closely tied to the family for the rest of his long life, eventually tutoring William&#x2019;s son and heir, serving as an agent in their political intrigues and a propagandist for their causes, becoming virtually a member of the aristocratic family. <br>The Cavendishes were bulwarks of the monarchy and its Church of England, created after Henry VIII&#x2019;s rejection of papal authority. For a long time, Hobbes echoed their devotion, but he was motivated not by doctrinal faith, or piety, or self-interest. In an age when the old foundations of authority were being dismantled, he proposed a new, even sterner justification of power: the preservation of order against man&#x2019;s instinct for selfishness and violence. <br>Aristotle and two millennia of pagan and Christian followers had held that &#x201c;the polis belongs to the class of things that exist by nature, and that man is by nature an animal intended to live in a polis.&#x201d; But for Hobbes, men were not naturally social creatures. The human being was an animal driven selfishly by appetites, by passions, above all by &#x201c;a perpetuall and restlesse desire of Power after power, that ceaseth onely in Death,&#x201d; devoted to assuring &#x201c;for ever, the way of his future desire.&#x201d; Not naturally social creatures, men sought their own selfish ends at any cost. Their original state was lawless, a &#x201c;War of every man against every man,&#x201d; violent disorder, total insecurity, and fear. Far from &#x201c;contented,&#x201d; human lives in that state could be nothing but &#x201c;solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.&#x201d; <br>Hobbes&#x2019;s terrifying portrait of the &#x201c;state of nature&#x201d; did not rely on the doctrine of original sin, nor was its alternative the city of God. He considered himself a scientist, and, like many of the Enlightenment&#x2019;s most innovative thinkers, his &#x201c;natural philosophy&#x201d; aimed at a unified body of scientific thought, from fundamental principles of matter and motion to geometry, mechanics, physics, to moral and civil philosophy. Hobbes refused to acknowledge theology as a science and ridiculed churchmen who offered authoritative views about God, describing them as a &#x201c;Confederacy of Deceivers&#x201d; who endeavored to control men &#x201c;by dark, and erroneous Doctrines, to extinguish in them the Light, both of Nature, and of the Gospell.&#x201d; In his own doctrine, &#x201c;the good,&#x201d; the summit of ethics classical and Christian, was nothing more than &#x201c;the common name for all things that are desired&#x201d; and these were &#x201c;relative to person, place, and time.&#x201d; <br>But while Hobbes showed that men were powerfully inclined to pursue immediate goals, he also believed that they were capable of acting on long-term interests. In the Enlightenment, the highest quality of human beings was not their resemblance to God but their capacity to reason. For Hobbes, reason was what distinguished men from beasts; it gave humans the power to control and guide the passions. It also distinguished civil society from the chaos of the natural state. Men were motivated to join together in a social compact by fear and the desire for self-preservation. They reasoned that by sacrificing an anarchic freedom, they would gain the safety of laws. <br>Hobbes imagined that civil society was conventional, the product of an agreement among men to submit to government. But given his gloomy view of human nature, how could government achieve its main end, &#x201c;the procuration of <i>the safety of the people</i>&#x201d;? As he warned, &#x201c;Covenants, without the Sword, are but Words, and of no strength to secure a man at all.&#x201d; Obedience to the laws, if not given freely, must be coerced. Or as philosopher Alan Ryan summarized it: &#x201c;The sovereign in effect says to us, &#x2018;If you submit, I will not kill you.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>Hobbes was no democrat. To allow men a voice in their own government was to invite conflict, factionalism, and perhaps a relapse to the anarchy of nature. For similar reasons, he objected to any group or allegiance that might stand between sovereign and citizen and dilute the latter&#x2019;s submission to the former. He was suspicious of aristocracies and universities and guilds&#x2014;even those of beggars&#x2014;that might challenge the authority of the sovereign. <br>As for the church, it should be under the complete control of the sovereign power; otherwise it would establish &#x201c; <i>Supremacy</i> against the <i>Soveraignty,</i> <i>Canons</i> against <i>Lawes,</i> and a <i>Ghostly Authority</i> against the <i>Civill</i>.&#x201d; In Hobbes&#x2019;s commonwealth, it was not private belief that counted but conformity in conduct, a willingness, as political scientist Patricia Springborg put it, &#x201c;to profess what is commanded&#x201d; by the sovereign as &#x201c;commander of the faithful.&#x201d; Conscience was free, a personal matter, but speech was public and subject to control. &#x201c;The tongue of man,&#x201d; Hobbes warned, &#x201c;is a trumpet of warre, and sedition.&#x201d; <br>So dire was the state of nature, he reckoned, that men would sacrifice everything except their lives to escape it. His was a profoundly pessimistic view of men, medieval in its gloom, lacking the faith in human progress that would drive and inspire other Enlightenment leaders. But the medieval church and its philosophers had at least offered the possibility of grace and ultimate salvation. For Hobbes, there was only the eternal struggle against the darkness and disorder that were the work not of the devil but of men themselves, written in their nature. Yet his justification of civil society and his account of its formation by the consent of the governed became cornerstones of Enlightenment thought, adopted by such diverse thinkers as Spinoza and Locke and Rousseau as well as American and French revolutionaries. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Through the Cavendishes, Hobbes had met Francis Bacon, whose proposal of a new empirical science to replace the arid abstractions of medieval scholasticism gave the Enlightenment its characteristic methods of inquiry and reason. Born in 1561, Bacon was well connected in the courts of Elizabeth I and James I and held an array of offices before reaching the pinnacle as lord chancellor in 1618, about the time Hobbes met him and, according to biographer John Aubrey, served as his secretary. Bacon was a lord, a courtier, a statesman, a polymath, yet he had the revolutionary idea that the search for truth began with the humble station of a <i>fact</i>. For millennia scientists and philosophers had trod in the path of Aristotle, beginning with their conclusion, the assertion of a &#x201c;truth,&#x201d; and then seeking proofs for it. &#x201c;In the manner of spiders,&#x201d; Bacon wrote, they spun &#x201c;webs from their own entrails.&#x201d; Science and philosophy had been left to the &#x201c;blindness of traditions, the swirling bluster of arguments, or the turbulent waves of chance&#x201d;&#x2014;to everything but &#x201c;experience marshalled and well-grounded&#x201d; in fact. Fact was reason&#x2019;s raw material, from which the scientist or philosopher could reach more and more general truths, ascending &#x201c;the proper ladder by successive, uninterrupted or unbroken steps, from particulars to lower axioms, then to middle ones, each higher than the last.&#x201d; Ultimately, they would arrive at what Bacon considered the grand prize, knowledge of the laws that govern the physical world. And knowledge was power: &#x201c;the sovereignty of Man lieth hid in knowledge&nbsp;&#x2026; which kings with their treasure cannot buy, nor with their force command.&#x201d; <br>This powerful man did not disdain the gritty work of gathering facts. Indeed, according to a story Hobbes told Aubrey, Bacon died of it. Traveling in a coach through snow one day in March 1626, Bacon suddenly was struck by the question whether &#x201c;flesh might not be preserved in snow, as in Salt.&#x201d; Stopping the coach, he went to a poor woman&#x2019;s house nearby and bought a hen. After the woman gutted it, Bacon stuffed the bird with snow. The outcome of the test is not known, nor has a connection between this experiment, the chill the snow gave him, and Bacon&#x2019;s subsequent illness been proven. The fact, at least as attested by Hobbes, is that the father of the modern scientific method died two or three days later. <br>Following Bacon, Hobbes built his own general ideas up from observations and experience, including, doubtless, his own profound fears of violence, dissolution, and death. The battles of the Reformation continued to rage, and in Protestant England, they grew ever more intense, with the threat of aggression by Catholic Spain, the nearly successful attempt in 1605 by Catholic extremists to blow up the king and Parliament, and the rising tensions between Crown and Commons, a power struggle embittered by sectarianism. All this threatened to destabilize Hobbes&#x2019;s world. In 1640, as Parliament undertook to examine &#x201c;the prerogative of the king,&#x201d; Hobbes felt &#x201c;a disorder comming on&#x201d; and feared that, owing to his own defense of monarchical power, anti-royalist enemies would persecute him. He found haven in France, where, for a decade, while England exploded into a civil war that climaxed with the beheading of Charles I in 1649, Hobbes enjoyed his most creative period, culminating with the publication of his masterwork, <i>Leviathan,</i> in 1651. A special vellum copy of the book was presented to the late king&#x2019;s heir, Charles II, also in French exile. <br>But Hobbes was nothing if not a realist. <i>Leviathan</i>&#x2019;s description of the religious establishment as a &#x201c;Kingdome of Darknesse&#x201d; that seduced men &#x201c;by abuse of Scripture&#x201d; made him enemies in Charles&#x2019;s Anglican circles, as well as among the powerful French clergy, who reportedly sought his arrest. In 1652, Hobbes returned to England, where the old royalist soon enough made peace with Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s Puritan Commonwealth. And why not? Cromwell met the two critical conditions of a sovereign&#x2014;he had the power to protect the people, as Charles over in France did not, and he had the consent of the people, which, even if gained through force and fear, was valid. Even monarchists owed the Commonwealth obedience. <br>The consistency of Hobbes&#x2019;s stance failed, of course, to impress the royal court and its clerics after Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660. Though he had come safely back into the Cavendish fold, Hobbes was denounced from the pulpit as an atheist and denied membership in the Royal Society for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge, created by the king after the Restoration. The Royal Society would become one of Europe&#x2019;s greatest vehicles of enlightenment, a place for leading scientists to discuss experimental results and new hypotheses. But so soon after the Civil War and Restoration, even members sympathetic to Hobbes were inclined to be cautious. They may have respected his ideas, but they feared his notoriety, while Aristotelians and religious conservatives rejected him on principle. Hobbes, naturally, gave as good as&#x2014;or better than&#x2014;he got, jeering at the Royal Society&#x2019;s cult of laborious experimentation, the waste of &#x201c;the expense of machines of difficult manufacture, just so you could get as far as Hobbes had already progressed.&#x201d; Why, he asked arrogantly, continuing in the third person, &#x201c;did you not use the principles he established?&#x201d; <br>Hobbes continued to write, argue, and criticize well into his final years. He was ninety when a crisis erupted that was all too reminiscent of the prelude to the Civil War. In 1678, after Charles&#x2019;s heir apparent...</p><h2>The Lonely Dead</h2><p>Brand New, Perfect condition</p><p>Michael Marshall is a full-time writer.

Sawyer, the award-winning and bestselling writer, hits the peak of his powers in <i>Humans</i>, the second book of <i>The Neanderthal Parallax</i>, his trilogy about our world and parallel one in which it was the Homo sapiens who died out and the Neanderthals who became the dominant intelligent species. This powerful idea allows Sawyer to examine some of the deeply rooted assumptions of contemporary human civilization dramatically, by confronting us with another civilization, just as morally valid, that has made other choices. In Humans, Neanderthal physicist Ponter Boddit, a character you will never forget, returns to our world and to his relationship with geneticist Mary Vaughan, as cultural exchanges between the two Earths begin.<br><br>As we see daily life in another present-day world, radically different from ours, in the course of Sawyer's fast-moving story, we experience the bursts of wonder and enlightenment that are the finest pleasures of science fiction. <i>Humans</i> is one of the best SF novels of the year, and <i>The Neanderthal Parallax</i> is an SF classic in the making.<br></p><p><b>Robert J. Sawyer </b>was born in Ottawa and lives in Mississauga, Ontario. He was a Hugo Award nominee in 2001 for <i>Calculating God</i>.<br>Chapter One<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It was Mary Vaughan's final evening in Sudbury, and she was experiencing decidedly mixed feelings.<br>She had no doubt that getting out of Toronto had done her good. After what had happened down there--<i>My God</i>, she thought, <i>had it really only been two weeks ago</i>?--leaving town, getting away from all the things that would have reminded her of that horrible night, was surely the right course. And although it had ended on a melancholy note, she wouldn't have traded her time here with Ponter Boddit for anything.<br>There was an unreal quality to her recollections; it all seemed so fantastic. And yet there were countless photographs and videos and even some X rays to prove that it had really happened. A modern Neanderthal from a parallel version of Earth had somehow slipped into this universe. Now that he was gone, Mary hardly believed it herself.<br>But it <i>had</i> happened. Ponter had really been here, and she had indeed...<br>Was she overstating it? Magnifying it in her mind?<br>No. No, it was indeed what had occurred.<br>She had come to love Ponter, maybe even to be <i>in</i> love with him.<br>If only she'd been whole, complete, unviolated, untraumatized, perhaps things would have been different. Oh, she'd still have fallen for the big guy--of that she was sure--but when he'd reached out and touched her hand that night while they were looking up at the stars, she wouldn't have frozen.<br>It had been too soon, she'd told him the next day. Too soon after...<br>She hated the word; hated to think it, to say it.<br>Too soon after the rape.<br>And tomorrow she had to go back home, back to where that rape had occurred, back to the campus of Toronto's York University, and her old life of teaching genetics.<br>Her old life of being alone.<br>She'd miss many things about Sudbury. She'd miss the lack of traffic congestion. She'd miss the friends she'd made here, including Reuben Montego and, yes, even Louise Benoï¿½t. She'd miss the relaxed atmosphere of tiny Laurentian University, where she'd done her mitochondrial DNA studies that had proven Ponter Boddit was indeed a Neanderthal.<br>But, most of all, she realized, as she stood at the side of the country road looking up at the clear night sky, she'd miss <i>this</i>. She'd miss seeing stars in a profusion beyond counting. She'd miss seeing the Andromeda galaxy, which Ponter had identified for her. She'd miss seeing the Milky Way, arching overhead.<br>And--<br>Yes!<br>Yes!<br>She'd especially miss this: the aurora borealis, flickering and weaving across the northern sky, pale green sheets of light, ghostly curtains.<br>Mary had indeed hoped to catch another glimpse of the aurora tonight. She'd been on her way back from Reuben Montego's place out in Lively (hah!), where she'd had a final barbecue dinner with him and Louise, and she'd pulled over at the side of the road specifically to look up at the night sky.<br>The heavens were cooperating. The aurora was breathtaking.<br>She'd forever associate the northern lights with Ponter. The only other time she'd seen them had been with him. She felt an odd sensation in her chest, the expanding feeling that went with awe battling the contracting sensation that accompanied sadness.<br>The lights were beautiful.<br>He was gone.<br>A cool green glow bathed the landscape as the aurora continued to flicker and dance, aspens and birches silhouetted in front of the spectacle, their branches waving slightly in the gentle August breeze.<br>Ponter had said he often saw the aurora. Partly that was because his cold-adapted people preferred more northerly latitudes than did the humans of this world.<br>Partly, too, it was because the phenomenal Neanderthal sense of smell and their ever-vigilant Companion implants made it safe to be out even in the dark; Ponter's hometown of Saldak, located at the same place in his world as Sudbury was in this world, didn't illuminate its streets at night.<br>And partly it was because the Neanderthals used clean solar power for most of their energy needs, rendering their skies far less polluted than the ones here.<br>Mary had made it to her current age of thirty-eight before seeing the aurora, and she didn't anticipate any reason to come back to Northern Ontario, so tonight, she knew, might well be the last time she'd ever see the undulating northern lights.<br>She drank in the view.<br>Some things were the same on both versions of Earth, Ponter had said: the gross details of the geography, most of the animal and plant species (although the Neanderthals, never having indulged in overkilling, still had mammoths and moas in their world), the broad strokes of the climate. But Mary was a scientist: she understood all about chaos theory, about how the beating of a butterfly's wing was enough to affect weather systems half a world away. Surely just because there was a clear sky here on this Earth didn't mean the same was true on Ponter's world.<br>But if the weather did happen to coincide, perhaps Ponter was also looking up at the night sky now.<br>And perhaps he was thinking of Mary.<br>Ponter would, of course, be seeing precisely the same constellations, even if he gave them different names--nothing terrestrial could possibly have disturbed the distant stars. But would the auroras be the same? Did butterflies or people have any effect on the choreography of the northern lights? Perhaps she and Ponter were looking at the exact same spectacle--a curtain of illumination waving back and forth, the seven bright stars of the Big Dipper (or, as he would call it, the Head of the Mammoth) stretching out above.<br>Why, he might even right now be seeing the same shimmying to the right, the same shimmying to the left, the same--<br><i>Jesus</i>.<br>Mary felt her jaw drop.<br>The auroral curtain was splitting down the middle, like aquamarine tissue paper being torn by an invisible hand. The fissure grew longer, wider, starting at the top and moving toward the horizon. Mary had seen nothing like that on the first night she'd looked up at the northern lights.<br>The sheet finally separated into two halves, parting like the Red Sea before Moses. A few--they looked like sparks, but could they really be that?--arced between the halves, briefly bridging the gap. And then the half on the right seemed to roll up from the bottom, like a window blind being wound onto its dowel, and, as it did so, it changed colors, now green, now blue, now violet, now orange, now turquoise.<br>And then in a flash--a spectral burst of light--that part of the aurora disappeared.<br>The remaining sheet of light was swirling now, as if it were being sucked down a drain in the firmament. As it spun more and more rapidly, it flung off gouts of cool green fire, a pin-wheel against the night.<br>Mary watched, transfixed. Even if this was only her second night actually observing the aurora, she'd seen countless pictures of the northern lights over the years in books and magazines. She'd known those still images hadn't done justice to the spectacle; she'd read how the aurora rippled and fluttered.<br>But nothing had prepared her for this.<br>The vortex continued to contract, growing brighter as it did so, until finally, with--did she really hear it?--with what sounded like a <i>pop</i>, it vanished.<br>Mary staggered backward, bumping up against the cold metal of her rented Dodge Neon. She was suddenly aware that the forest sounds around her--insects and frogs, owls and bats--had fallen silent, as if every living thing was looking up in wonder.<br>Mary's heart was pounding, and one thought kept echoing through her head as she climbed into the safety of her car.<br><i>I wonder if it's supposed to do that</i>...<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright ï¿½ 2003 by Robert J.

An international bestseller and winner of the Whitbread Biography Award, <i>Bad Blood</i> is a tragicomic memoir of one woman's escape from a claustrophobic childhood in post-World War II Britain and the story of three generations of the author's family and its marriages. </p> <p> In one of the most extraordinary memoirs of recent years, <i>Bad Blood</i> brings alive in vivid detail a time - the '40s and '50s - not so distant from us but now disappeared. As a portrait of a family and a young girl's place in it, it is unsurpassed. </p></p><p>Nobody's unhappy family was ever quite like that of Lorna Sage, whose ruthlessly funny, excruciating, inspiring memoir <i>Bad Blood</i> won England's Whitbread Biography Award. She grew up in the '40s on the Welsh border, in the crossfire between her grandparents, a bitter, bibulous, bookish vicar resembling Jack Sprat and his short, "fat doll" of an ignorant wife. He preached earthy sermons about how one might prefer for a wife "Martha before dinner, Mary after dinner." His wife's "notion of marriage [was] that a man signed you up to have his wicked way with you and should spend the rest of his life <i>paying through the nose</i>." Grandma blackmailed the vicar with his diary of adultery, in which she scribbled vicious comments invaluable to the family historian. She gobbled sweets; he drank, fumed, and helped make Lorna Sage a noted literary critic. There is much more: the vicar's affair with his daughter's school chum, the cosmic impact of Bill Haley and his Comets, Lorna's precocious pregnancy, and the strange way lives ricochet and echo each other. Sage manages to give her rural upbringing a brooding Gothic poignance and the comic force of <i>Cold Comfort Farm</i>. She describes a moment after her grandfather's death in the vicarage, "where everything seemed to be wearing thin and getting see-through, as though a spell were dissolving." But the shades of her clan won't quite fade, and thanks to this book, they're here to stay. <i>--Tim Appelo</i><p>An influential literary critic, Lorna Sage taught English at British and American universities and was most recently professor of English at the University of East Anglia. Her previous books include <i>Women in the House of Fiction, The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English,</i> and a short monograph on Angela Carter.</p></p><h2>Batman Four of a Kind</h2><p>This paperback collects the 1995 Year One Annuals of four Batman villains.

Where will it land? Seeds splash away in raindrops, slide across the snow, and hitch rides on birds and animals&#x2014;and even people's clothing.<br> &nbsp;<br> For anyone who's ever blown the fluff of a dandelion and wondered where it went, this is the perfect introduction to plant life cycles and seed dispersals for young readers. The simple, poetic text is paired with detailed illustrations and close-ups of seeds, pods, and other parts of plants. <br> &nbsp;<br> A brief illustrated glossary and a note on why seeds travel so far is included. Perfect for fans of Gail Gibbons' <i>From Seed to Plant</i>.</p><p>JoAnn Early Macken has written dozens of books for young readers including poetry, picture books, beginning readers, and nonfiction. Her "Sing-Along Song" illustrated by LeUyen Pham was chosen for the Texas 2 x 2 Reading List. She lives in Wisconsin with her family.<br><br>Pam Paparone has both written and illustrated books for children. Kirkus Reviews praised the "bright, elegant acrylics" she created for D. Anne Love&#x2019;s "Of Numbers and Stars: The Story of Hypatia". She lives in Pennsylvania.Grade 3&#x2013;4&#x2014;Macken's crisp text reveals burdocks sticking to a kid's socks and to a rabbit's fur, touch-me-not seeds exploding from their pods, and acorns being interred energetically by provident squirrels. A final segment explores several kinds of seed "containers" (pods, fruit, nutshells) and the varying shapes of a number of seeds (peach pits, corn kernels, peas), and explains the stages of growth from seed to flowering plant. All the while, in careful step, Paparone's bright, realistic acrylics present clear pictures of the featured seeds in their natural dispersals, from tumbleweeds rolling across a Western landscape to coconuts dropping into a tropical sea. Many of the double-page illustrations contain a circular "bubble" with close-ups of leaves, flowers, pods, etc. Team this inviting introduction with Ken Robbins's elegant <i>Seeds</i> (S &amp; S, 2005) and/or Helene J. Jordan's simple <i>How a Seed Grows</i> (HarperTrophy, 1992), or perhaps Sam Godwin's even simpler <i>A Seed in Need</i> (Picture Window, 2004) for a seed-full good time.&#x2014;<i>Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She lives with her family in Australia, near the sea.</p>Wanted! A Guinea Pig Called Henry<br>1When Nelly was a tiny, round brown puppy with short legs and a stumpy tail, she lived with a baby boy and his mother.Nelly and the baby boy were always together. They rolled and tumbled across the floor and around the backyard. They played tug-of-war, splashed together in mud puddles, and dug in the sandbox.When the baby boy cried, Nelly snuggled beside him, fussing over him as if she were a mother dog and he was her puppy.But when the baby was a nearly two-year-old walking, talking little boy andNelly was an already grown-up dog, the mother got a new job in a country on the other side of the world. She and her little boy had to move, and they could not take Nelly with them.The mother asked all her family and friends, but no one had a place for Nelly. There was only one thing she could do."We'll take her to the Rainbow Street Animal Shelter and ask them to find her a good home," the mother said.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Rainbow Street was short and narrow. At the end, surrounded by a tall wire fence, was a big garden with shady trees andgreen lawns. The building at its front was pale blue, with a bright rainbow arching over the cheery, cherry red door."Can I help you?" squawked a gray parrot as the little boy and his mother stepped into the waiting room with Nelly.A young woman with long dark hair wound up above a kind face and a name tag that said MONA came out from a door. "Gulliver likes being the receptionist," she explained."Gulliver!" the parrot agreed, in his croaky old man's voice.The mother smiled, and her little boy laughed.But the little boy stopped laughing when his mother said good-bye to Nellyand lifted her into Mona's arms. He did not want to leave without his friend. He threw himself onto the floor, kicking and screaming in the loudest, most ferocious tantrum of his whole life.With a wriggle and a squirm, Nelly leapt out of Mona's arms. She snuggled in tight against the little boy's side, licking the tears off his face until he had to giggle.Then his mother picked him up, Mona picked up Nelly, and they said good-bye. The mother felt like crying, too, but she knew that this was the best place for the little stumpy-tailed dog to find a new home.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Mona met lots of dogs every day, but shehad never met one who worked so hard at making someone feel better."Now you need someone to look after you!" she said, when the little boy and his mother had gone. She stroked firmly down Nelly's back, one hand after the other, over and over, till the round brown body started to relax.A gray-haired man came in from the dog runs, and smiled to see Mona sitting on the floor with the dog. He had never seen his busy friend look so relaxed."Will I take her out to a kennel now?" Juan asked gently. His voice was the same as the parrot's."<i>Hola</i>, <i>amigo!</i>" screeched Gulliver, flapping his wings with excitement."In a minute," said Mona, still stroking the little brown dog.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But before she could get up, the door burst open and a man came in carrying a white cat wrapped in a towel."She was running down the middle of the road, scared out of her wits!" the man said. "I don't know where she came from."He put the cat bundle down on the floor.Nelly leapt toward it.The cat hissed, spat, and backed into a corner."Nelly!" shouted Mona."Sorry!" said the man."Can I help you?" screeched Gulliver."I think it's okay," said Juan--because Nelly was not chasing the cat. Even when she waved a scratching claw at Nelly's nose, the little brown dog just crept forward on her belly, her head down and bottom up, stumpy tail wagging.The white cat meowed but didn't hiss.Nelly crept closer and started to lick the frightened cat. The cat twitched her tail in annoyance, but let the dog go on licking.Finally, the cat gave a shake and jumped up onto the windowsill. She began smoothing her rumpled fur with her neat white paws, looking around the room as if she had always been there."I've never seen anything like that before!" said the man who'd rescued her."Neither have I," said Juan."Nelly," said Mona, "I think you've found your home."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So Nelly became Mona's dog, and came to the shelter with her every day.The white cat stayed, too. No one ever came to find her, and she never wanted to leave the office. Juan named her Blanco,but even though Blanco loved Juan more than any other person, she never wanted to go home with him. She was happy just to curl up in her basket under the desk for the night.In the morning, when Nelly and Mona came in, she rushed to greet them. Nelly licked her face till Blanco blinked and leapt up to her windowsill to wash the doggy kisses off her fur. For the rest of the day, she sat there watching everything that happened, letting people pat her if they asked politely, and keeping out of the way of the other dogs and cats as they came through the waiting room.But Nelly liked meeting the people and animals that arrived feeling lost orworried. When puppies or kittens needed mothering, she stayed with them till they could be alone or were ready to be adopted. And if they were very young, Mona took them home at night so she could give them their midnight milk and Nelly could snuggle them all night long.Text copyright ï¿½ 2012 by Wendy Orr</p><h2>Faith Ringgold: A View from the Studio</h2><p>When you look out of your studio window, what do you see? I see my determination to be free in America. <em>Faith Ringgold: A View From the Studio</em> is a remarkable book about a world-famous Black American artist. It is an artist's artist's book--by one artist and about another--about the making of art, about politics and judgment, about passion and struggle. It is, above all, about a great artist's collaboration with others in the creation of a unique body of work, which expresses a deeply committed vision of American history and the struggle for freedom. Whether in the deeply personal works such as Coming to Jones Road or the more public statements in The Death of Apartheid and No More War, Faith Ringgold expresses a bold vision that celebrates a debt to the powerful and enduring legacy of African- American literature, music, poetry, and painting. A courageous, experimental artist with a deep sense of public responsibility, she is the embodiment of one of the richest traditions in American art. Curlee Holton, a long-time collaborator of Faith's and her principal printmaker, has written about his fellow artist's creative methods, studio work, and many sources of inspiration. Curlee reveals an artist endowed with an unquenchable energy that communicates itself to all who come into contact with her, be they children, students, artists, or her many admirers and collectors, both private and institutional. As a printmaker and teacher, Curlee pays particular attention to the nature of Faith's working relationship with himself and other printers such as Bob Blackburn and John Phillips, as well as to the remarkable collaboration between Faith and her mother, Willie Posie.</p><p>Faith Ringgold, artist and author lives and works in Englewood, New Jersey. Ringgold&#39;s art has been exhibited worldwide. She has written and illustrated fourteen children&#39;s books including, Tar Beach which has won more than 30 awards including a Caldecott Honor and the Coretta Scott King Award.</p><h2>Apocalyptic Spirituality: Treatises and Letters of Lactantius, Adso of Montier-en-Der, Joachim of Fiore, the Franciscan Spirituals, Savonarola</h2><p>This book makes available major texts in the Christian apocalyptic literature form the 4th to the 16th centuries. The apocalyptic tradition is that of traditional prophecy based on revelation and concerned with the end of the world. Even an age such as ours characterized by its scientific and rationalistic outlook has strong elements of literal apocalypticism found in fundamentalist and charismatic groups. The popular success of Hal Lindsey's The Late Great Planet Earth is evidence of this. Also the present hunger for apocalypse has adopted a variety of secular disguises typified by Heilbroner's An Inquiry into the Human Prospect. Contemporary theologians like Kasemann, Pannenberg, Rahner, Moltmann and others have devoted much of their work to the meaning of apocalyptic thought. This is a collection which can show the traditional roots of this contemporary phenomenon. <p>Dr. Bernard McGinn says in his introduction, these treatises and letters have been chosen because of the way in which they manifest how beliefs about the imminent end affected the lives of their adherents..." Perhaps the task for us today is that by seeing how the lives of Lactantius, the monk Adso, Joachim of Fiore, The Spiritual Franciscans and Savonarola were affected by their apocalyptic vision we can recognize how our lives are being affected by the contemporary prophetic sense of the end of history.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)</p><h2>Long Island Landscape Painting 1820-1920</h2><p>Examines the paintings of Long Island scenes by artists such as William Merritt Chase, Winslow Homer, and George Bellows</p><p>Aside from their artistic merit and facile charms, these pictures of a bygone Long Island have great sociological interest as a documentary portrait of a way of life now largely eclipsed by suburbia and industrialization. After the Civil War, wealthy New Yorkers built baronial estates on Long Island. The tourist industry was flourishing by the turn of the century, and artists like William Merritt Chase and William Sidney Mount came to paint the ever-changing skies and pastoral views. Cider making, eel spearing, card players and farmers, steamboats and summer homes are among the subjects depicted. The Tile Club, a group of artists and writers that included Chase and Winslow Homer, explored Montauk Point's gardens and beaches. The island also left its mark on William Glackens, who did Impressionist seascapes, as well as Childe Hassam and George Bellows. The superb quality of the 98 full-page color reproductions make this slender volume notable. Beautiful maps of Long Island serve as endpapers.

He lives with his husband, Danish artist and school administrator Ole Flemming Larsen, near Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>Despite having conducted dozens of interviews with those who knew Olivier, Spoto (author of biographies of Hitchcock, Tennessee Williams, and others) offers little important new material--and few fresh insights--in this long, uninspired biography. Aside from lots of sexual tattle, much of it unsupported by sources, and an unconvincing minority opinion on Vivien Leigh's mental troubles, most everything here has been covered before (and, often, better) elsewhere. Like Anthony Holden (Laurence Olivier, 1988), Spoto takes a largely unfriendly view of Sir Larry--seen throughout as primarily ambitious, envious, ungrateful (to Gielgud especially), and ``emotionally inaccessible.'' Also like Holden, Spoto emphasizes Olivier's guilt-ridden nature; unlike Holden, though, Spoto links it to a struggle with bisexuality, supposedly evidenced by a ten- year affair with Danny Kaye (cf. Michael Korda's recent roman ... clef) and quasi-sexual attachments to Noel Coward, Kenneth Tynan, and others. As for women, there were brief encounters (Greer Garson, Sarah Miles, Claire Bloom, etc.) and three unhappy marriages; in Spoto's iffy version, Joan Plowright is an uncaring opportunist, Vivien Leigh a self-indulgent sensualist (rather than a manic-depressive). And his interpretation of Olivier's amazing career and art is only slightly more persuasive: the stage and film work, the rise and fall at the National Theatre, all receive conscientious attention--but Spoto's attempts at analyzing the Olivier genius largely slide into psychobabble and platitude: ``This awareness of inadequacy was suffused by a mysterious gift, enabling him to pass the single beam of his own humanity through the prism of a role--and the emerging, manifold ray reached the countless different lives of his spectators.'' Sure to be read for the gossip, and worth skimming for curious bits of interview material, but--with its flat delivery and spotty documentation--an only so-so addition to the crowded Olivier reference room.

And, on her own, she will plot her revenge&#x2014;against the man who tried to kill her, and the government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life. <p>Once upon a time, she was a victim. Now, Lisbeth Salander is ready to fight back.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2010</strong> As the finale to Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, <i>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest </i>is not content to merely match the adrenaline-charged pace that made international bestsellers out of <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em> and <em>The Girl Who Played with Fire</em>. Instead, it roars with an explosive storyline that blows the doors off the series and announces that the very best has been saved for last. A familiar evil lies in wait for Lisbeth Salander, but this time, she must do more than confront the miscreants of her past; she must destroy them. Much to her chagrin, survival requires her to place a great deal of faith in journalist Mikael Blomkvist and trust his judgment when the stakes are highest. To reveal more of the plot would be criminal, as Larsson's mastery of the unexpected is why millions have fallen hard for his work. But rest assured that the odds are again stacked, the challenges personal, and the action fraught with neck-snapping revelations in this snarling conclusion to a thrilling triad. This closing chapter to The Girl's pursuit of justice is guaranteed to leave readers both satisfied and saddened once the final page has been turned. <em>--Dave Callanan</em><b>Stieg Larsson</b> (1954-2004) was the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine Expo from 1999, and had previously worked at a major news agency for many years. He was one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on anti-democratic, right-wing extremist and Nazi organisations, and he was often consulted on that account. He passed away suddenly and unexpectedly in November 2004, some time before the publication of his debut crime novel and first part of the Millennium Trilogy.</p><h2>The Redeemed (Walk in the Light, Volume 6)</h2><p>This book is volume six in the highly acclaimed Walk in the Light series written by Todd D Bennett. It is not necessary to read the rest of the series as each book is designed to stand alone. The Redeemed provides a fresh examination of a very controversial subject concerning the chosen people. While both Christianity and Judaism lay claim to this special status you will likely be surprised by the findings in this book taken directly from the Scriptures without any religious bias. This is a must read for anyone interested in learning how they fit into the plan of the Creator to restore all of creation.</p><p>Todd D. Bennett is an attorney and the author of 13 books including the highly acclaimed Walk in the Light series. Todd lives in upstate New York with his wife and two children.

This revised edition contains a new final chapter on the future of the charismatic movement.</p><p>Though countless Christians through the ages have confessed, bI believe in the Holy Spirit, b the Spirit has often remained a shadowy figure, relegated to the fringes of many Christiansb faith. In some quarters, however, the rise of the charismatic movement has made the Holy Spirit a focus of heated controversy. <p>In this updated edition of his widely popular book, Michael Green traces the doctrine of the Holy Spirit through the Bible, discusses the baptism and gifts of the Spirit, and addresses the dynamic, ongoing work of the Spirit in todaybs church and world. Enriched by Greenbs extensive teaching, pastoral, and personal experience, "I Believe in the Holy Spirit" remains one of the clearest, most balanced books ever written on this subject.</p>Michael Green is senior research fellow at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford University.</p><h2>The Orbital Perspective: Lessons in Seeing the Big Picture from a Journey of 71 Million Miles</h2><p>For astronaut Ron Garan, living on the International Space Station was a powerful, transformative experience&#x2014;one that he believes holds the key to solving our problems here on Earth. <br><br> On space walks and through windows, Garan was struck by the stunning beauty of the Earth from space but sobered by knowing how much needed to be done to help this troubled planet. And yet on the International Space Station, Garan, a former fighter pilot, was working work side by side with Russians, who only a few years before were &#x201c;the enemy.&#x201d; If fifteen nationalities could collaborate on one of the most ambitious, technologically complicated undertakings in history, surely we can apply that kind of cooperation and innovation toward creating a better world. That spirit is what Garan calls the &#x201c;orbital perspective.&#x201d;<br><br> Garan vividly conveys what it was like learning to work with a diverse group of people in an environment only a handful of human beings have ever known. But more importantly, he describes how he and others are working to apply the orbital perspective here at home, embracing new partnerships and processes to promote peace and combat hunger, thirst, poverty, and environmental destruction. This book is a call to action for each of us to care for the most important space station of all: planet Earth. You don&#x2019;t need to be an astronaut to have the orbital perspective. Garan&#x2019;s message of elevated empathy is an inspiration to all who seek a better world.</p><p>For astronaut Ron Garan, living on the International Space Station was transformative. If fifteen nations (some of them former enemies) can work together to create and run the most complex structure ever built in space, why can&#x2019;t we work together to solve our problems on earth? Garan shows how we can all gain this &#x201c;orbital perspective" to guide and inspire our efforts to build a better world.Col. Ron Garan (USAF ret.) is a decorated fighter pilot, astronaut, aquanaut, and entrepreneur. He has logged 178 days in space and 71 million miles in orbit.

Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was described as &#x201c;Churchill in a Yankees cap&#x201d; for his leadership during 9/11, wrote to Celia Sandys: "Your grandfather was a great source of inspiration and strength to me following the tragic events." Now, in <i>We Shall Not Fail</i>, Sandys has distilled the essential principles of leadership that guided Churchill throughout his remarkable career and highlights how you can apply them to your own work life. The lessons include:<br> * Nothing works like simple passion for excellence<br> * Encourage a culture where what counts is thinking, trying, and testing.<br> * Champion innovators and protect them from bureaucrats.<br> * Don&#x2019;t allow different standards for top executives and entry-level workers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing on vivid stories, letters, and speeches, Sandys reveals what we must learn if we are to lead in today&#x2019;s tough business environment by studying the actions and words of a man who is still regarded as an inspirational colossus.<br><br>&#x201c;He was, in that overused but inevitable phrase, &#x2018;larger than life.&#x2019; A leader.

The legwork is done for you. The chapter-by-chapter guides incorporate research-based, high-order reading, writing, and thinking activities.</p><p>What could be better than a magic cupboard that turns small toys into living creatures? Omri's big brother has no birthday present for him, so he gives Omri an old medicine cabinet he's found. Although their mother supplies a key, the cabinet still doesn't seem like much of a present. But when an exhausted Omri dumps a plastic toy Indian into the cabinet just before falling asleep, the magic begins. Turn the key once and the toy comes alive; turn it a second time and it's an action figure again. <p> <i>The Indian in the Cupboard</i> is one of those rare books that is equally appealing to children and adults. The story of Omri and the Indian, Little Bear, is replete with subtle reminders of the responsibilities that accompany friendship and love. For kids, it's a great yarn; for most parents, it's also a reminder that Omri's wrenching decision to send his toy back to its own world is not so different from the recognition of their children's emerging independence. </p><p> <i>The Indian in the Cupboard</i> is also available in Spanish (<i>La Llave Magica</i>.) (The publisher recommends this book for children ages 9-12, although younger kids will enjoy hearing it read aloud.)</p>"Skyhigh fantasy that will enthrall readers."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><p>"Best novel of the year (1981)."--<i>The New York Times</i>. </p><p>Rebecca Caudill Young Reader's Book Award, California Young Reader Medal, Pacific Northwest Young Readers Choice Award, A Virginia Young Readers Award.</p></p><h2>WuMo: Something Is Wrong</h2><p>The first collection of <i>WuMo</i>, the hit cartoon that appears in more than 300 newspapers in its first year of syndication!<br><br>The cartoon <i>WuMo</i> celebrates life's absurdity and bittersweet ironies, holding up a funhouse mirror to our modern world and those who live in it. Thanks to its delightful artwork and irreverent humor, this hilarious comic by writer Mikael Wulff and illustrator Anders Morgenthaler has grown from an underground sensation to one of the biggest and most popular strips in Europe.<i>WuMo</i>'s inventiveness is reminiscent of their countryman Hans Christian Andersen--if Andersen's fairy tales had been populated by sadistic pandas, disgruntled office workers, crazy beavers, Albert Einstein, Snoop Dogg, and Darth Vader.<br><br> Named <i>WuMo</i>, after the Danish duo&#x2019;s last names, it appears in the largest papers in northern Europe, including Germany&#x2019;s <i>Die Welt</i>, Denmark&#x2019;s <i>Politiken</i>, and Norway&#x2019;s <i>Dagbladet</i>.</p><p>Mikael Wulff is a stand-up comedian and has done several live one-man shows, released DVDs with his stand-up, and done his own TV and radio shows.<br><br>In addition to his illustration work, Anders Morgenthaler is also a movie director whose films range from children&#x2019;s movies about talking fruit to avant-garde art-house fare.

Their words can only speak for themselves: The total effect is one of littleness against an immensity of sea and sky; of a low, timeworn land, marvelously subtle and seasonally responsive in coloring. Where Land Meets Sea is a tone poem, a hymn of praise. - The New York Times.</p><p></p><h2>Being and Becoming: Psychodynamics, Buddhism, and the Origins of Selfhood</h2><p><i>Being and Becoming </i>is a wide-ranging analysis of the nature of being and selfhood. The book presents an original, integrated paradigm with the aim of creating a comprehensive overview of the human condition&#x2014;and finding ways to alleviate suffering. In essence, the book explores the question, &#x201c;What does it mean to be?&#x201d; <br><br><i>Being and Becoming </i>begins with fresh interpretations of the work of Martin Heidegger and Buddhist, Taoist, and Christian writings as they relate to this question. Most of <i>Being and Becoming, </i>however, is about the nature of self and selfhood as a process of &#x201c;I-am-this,&#x201d; &#x201c;my becoming&#x201d; rather than &#x201c;my being.&#x201d; Author Franklyn Sills interweaves concepts from object relations theories, psychodynamics, pre- and perinatal psychology, and Buddhist self-psychology, along with his own rich experience as a Buddhist monk, somatic therapist, and psychotherapist, into his inquiry. The works of Fairbairn and Winnicott are discussed in depth, as are Winnicott and Stern&#x2019;s insights into the nature of the early holding environment, the infant-mother relational field, and early perceptual dynamics. A thoughtful guide for psychologists, therapists, counselors, and other health professionals, the book is also ideal for Buddhists and anyone looking for alternative therapy models.</p><p>Franklyn Sills is the co-director of the Karuna Institute, and has pioneered trainings in Craniosacral Biodynamics and Core Process Psychotherapy. Engaged in an ambitious project to integrate Buddhist self-psychology with Western object relations and developmental theories, he lives in Devon, England.&#x201c;In <i>Being and Becoming, </i>Franklyn Sills offers us a wonderful synthesis of Western developmental concepts and Buddhist psychology. He presents an integrated paradigm for understanding the nature and development of selfhood and the suffering involved in its dynamics. He also stresses the importance of developing a state of being, one of moment-to-moment awareness, as the key to alleviating personal and interpersonal suffering.... A true guide through this multifaceted territory for clinician and layperson alike.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;James low, consultant psychotherapist at Guy&#x2019;s Hospital, London, and author of <i>Being Right Here</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Franklyn Sills is a true pioneer&#x2014;working in fields that can seem so different yet just yearn to come together in intelligent and comprehensible ways: psychotherapy, Buddhism, and perinatal psychology. The result is an almost unimaginably moving synthesis that is, at the same time, usable in a down-to-earth way by clinicians from diverse backgrounds and in a variety of settings.... Sills wears his immense learning lightly and is an affable and empathic guide into some difficult and mysterious areas of human experience, suffering, and joy.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Andrew Samuels, Professor of Analytical Psychology, University of Essex, U.K., Visiting Clinical Professor of Psychoanalysis, New York University, and author of <i>The Plural Psyche: Personality, Morality and the Father</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Franklyn&#x2019;s work, drawing together the insights of Buddhism and the understanding of psychotherapy, encourages each individual to bring their spirituality into the healing process. In this book, he draws on a lineage of analysts, psychotherapists, and Buddhist masters, as well as his own years of fieldwork to provide an in-depth and pragmatic guide. His writing forms a very solid, pragmatic, and technically sound exhortation to workers in the field to develop their compassion, their mindfulness and sensitivity, rather than just see patients through the lens of a textbook.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Ajahn Sucitto, Abbot of Chithurst Monastery, Petersfield, U.K.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Sills draws on a lineage of masters from many modalities: analysts, psychotherapists, Buddhist masters, as well as from the field of perinatal psychology, and his own many years of fieldwork... Sills considers therapy and the resolution of suffering as a reclamation of sorts, a return to our inherent spirituality. Based upon this experiential idea, he has constructed an in-depth and pragmatic guide for therapists wishing to develop their compassion, mindfulness, and sensitivity, and more effectively restore their clients to a sense of spiritual well-being.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>Keeping in Touch</i>, The United States Association for Body Psychotherapy</p><h2>Around the World Art &amp; Activities: Visiting the 7 Continents Through Craft Fun (Williamson Little Hands Series)</h2><p>This book is suitable for ages 4 to 8 years.

Little has been written about how to get started, or the answer to, 'What are we up against here?' <em>The Farmstead Creamery Advisor</em> fills in those blanks. One of the best pieces of advice in this book is for cheesemakers to build a base foundation beginning with proper business management. No matter how good the cheese, or how much you love your animals; everything depends upon a good business plan to eventually turn a profit. Especially useful, in addition, is Caldwell's chapter on developing an aging space in light of increasing energy costs. This has been a not-so-well thought out part of many cheesemaking projects, and could be some of the most important information in this book. To be sure, Gianaclis Caldwell asks the big questions that need to be considered before beginning to develop such a project; it's a true reality check every aspiring cheesemaker needs.

She wants to be a reporter, knowing full well that a few pieces published in the <i>Arlington News</i> will not suffice. Real reporters must go to Grand Places, and do Grand Things, like Hattie's hero Nellie Bly. Another girl might be stymied by this, but Hattie has faced down a hungry wolf and stood up to a mob of angry men. Nothing can squash her desire to write for a big city newspaper. A letter and love token from Uncle Chester's old flame in San Francisco fuels that desire and Hattie jumps at the opportunity to get there by working as a seamstress for a traveling acting troupe. This could be her chance to solve the mystery of her "scoundrel" uncle and, in the process, help her learn more about herself. But Hattie must first tell Charlie that she will not join him in Seattle. Even though her heart approves of Charlie's plan for their marriage, her mind fears that saying yes to him would be saying no to herself. Hattie holds her own in the big city, literally pitching her way to a byline, and a career that could be even bigger than Nellie Bly's. But can making headlines compensate for the pain of betrayal and lost love? Hattie must dig deep to find her own true place in the world. Kirby Larson once again creates a lovingly written novel about the remarkable and resilient young orphan, Hattie Inez Brooks.</p><p>After KIRBY LARSON heard a snippet of a story about her great-grandmother homesteading in eastern Montana, she went on to write <i>Hattie Big Sky,</i> winner of a 2007 Newbery Honor Award.

In <em>Who Owns the Future?</em>, Lanier is interested in how network technologies affect our culture, economy, and collective soul. Lanier is talking about pretty heady stuff--the monopolistic power of big tech companies (dubbed "Siren Servers"), the flattening of the middle class, the obscuring of humanity--but he has a gift for explaining sophisticated concepts with clarity. In fact, what separates Lanier from a lot of techno-futurists is his emphasis on the maintaining humanism and accessibility in technology. In the most ambitious part of the book, Lanier expresses what he believes to be the ideal version of the networked future--one that is built on two-way connections instead of one-way relationships, allowing content, media, and other innovations to be more easily attributed (including a system of micro-payments that lead back to its creator). Is the two-way networked vision of the internet proposed in Who Owns the Future quixotic? Even Lanier seems unsure, but his goal here is to establish a foundation for which we should strive. At one point, Lanier jokingly asks sci-fi author William Gibson to write something that doesn't depict technology as so menacing. Gibson replies, "Jaron, I tried. But it's coming out dark." Lanier is able to conjure a future that's much brighter, and hopefully in his imagination, we are moving closer to that. --<em>Kevin Nguyen</em><br><br> <p><b>Q&amp;A with Jaron Lanier</b></p> <p><strong>Q. Years ago, in the early days of networking, you and your friends asserted that information should be free. What made you change your tune?</strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong> In the big picture, a great new technology that makes the world more efficient should result in waves of new opportunity. That&#x2019;s what happened with, say, electricity, telephones, cars, plumbing, fertilizers, vaccinations, and many other examples. Why on earth have the early years of the network revolution been associated with recessions, austerity, jobless recoveries, and loss of social mobility? Something has clearly gone wrong.</p> <p>The old ideas about information being free in the information age ended up screwing over everybody except the owners of the very biggest computers. The biggest computers turned into spying and behavior modification operations, which concentrated wealth and power.</p> <p>Sharing information freely, without traditional rewards like royalties or paychecks, was supposed to create opportunities for brave, creative individuals. Instead, I have watched each successive generation of young journalists, artists, musicians, photographers, and writers face harsher and harsher odds. The perverse effect of opening up information has been that the status of a young person&#x2019;s parents matters more and more, since it&#x2019;s so hard to make one&#x2019;s way.</p> <p><strong>Q. Throughout history, technological revolutions have caused unemployment but also brought about new types of jobs to replace the old ones. What&#x2019;s different today?</strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> Cars can now drive themselves, and cloud services can translate passages between languages well enough to be of practical use. But the role of people in these technologies turned out to be a surprise.</p> <p> Back in the 1950s, the fantasy in the computer science world was that smart scientists would achieve machine intelligence and profound levels of automation, but that never worked. Instead, vast amounts of &#x201c;big data&#x201d; gathered from real people is rehashed to create automation. There are many, many real people behind the curtain.</p> <p>This should be great news for the future of employment! Multitudes of people are needed in order for robots to speak, drive cars, or perform operations. The only problem is that as the information age is dawning, the ideology of bright young people and newfangled plutocrats alike holds that information should be free.</p> <p><strong>Q. Who does own the future? What&#x2019;s up for grabs that will affect our future livelihoods?</strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> The answer is indeed up for grabs. If we keep on doing things as we are, the answer is clear: The future will be narrowly owned by the people who run the biggest, best connected computers, which will usually be found in giant, remote cloud computing farms.</p> <p> The answer I am promoting instead is that the future should be owned broadly by everyone who contributes data to the cloud, as robots and other machines animated by cloud software start to drive our vehicles, care for us when we&#x2019;re sick, mine our natural resources, create the physical objects we use, and so on, as the 21st century progresses.</p> <p>Right now, most people are only gaining <em>informal</em> benefits from advances in technology, like free internet services, while those who own the biggest computers are concentrating <em>formal</em> benefits to an unsustainable degree.</p> <p><strong>Q. What is a &#x201c;Siren Server&#x201d; and how does it function?</strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> I needed a broad name for the gargantuan cloud computer services that are concentrating wealth and influence in our era. They go by so many names! There are national intelligence agencies, the famous Silicon Valley companies with nursery school names, the stealthy high finance schemes, and others.</p> <p> All these schemes are quite similar. The biggest computers can predictably calculate wealth and clout on a broad, statistical level. For instance, an insurance company might use massive amounts of data to only insure people who are unlikely to get sick. The problem is that the risk and loss that can be <em>avoided</em> by having the biggest computer still <em>exist</em>. Everyone else must pay for the risk and loss that the Siren Server can avoid.</p> <p> The interesting thing about the original Homeric Sirens was that they didn&#x2019;t actually attack sailors. The fatal peril was that sailors volunteered to grant the sirens control of the interaction. That&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re all doing with the biggest computing schemes.</p> <p><strong>Q. As a solution to the economic problems caused by digital networks, you assert that each one of us should be paid for what we do and share online. How would that work?</strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> We&#x2019;ve all contributed to the fortunes of big Silicon Valley schemes, big finance schemes, and all manner of other schemes which are driven by computation over a network. But our contributions were deliberately forgotten. This is partly due to the ideology of copying without a trace that my friends and I mistakenly thought would lead to a fairer world, back in the day.</p> <p>The error we made was simple: Not all computers are created equal.</p> <p> What is clear is that networks <em>could</em> remember where the value actually came from, which is from a very broad range of people. I sketch a way that universal micropayments might solve the problem, though I am not attempting to present a utopian solution. Instead I hope to deprogram people from the &#x201c;open&#x201d; ideal to think about networks more broadly. I am certain that once the conversation escapes the bounds of what has become an orthodoxy, better ideas will come about.</p> <p><strong>Q. <em>Who Owns the Future</em> seems like two books in one. Does it seem that way to you?</strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> If all I wanted was sympathy and popularity, I am sure that a critique by itself&#x2014;without a proposal for a solution&#x2014;would have been more effective.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s true that the fixes put forward in <em>Who Owns the Future</em> are ambitious, but they are presented within an explicitly modest wrapping. I am hoping to make the world safer for diverse ideas about the future. Our times are terribly conformist. For instance, one is either &#x201c;red&#x201d; or &#x201c;blue,&#x201d; or is accepted by the &#x201c;open culture&#x201d; crowd or not. I seek to bust open such orthodoxies by showing that other ideas are possible. So I present an intentionally rough sketch of an alternate future that doesn&#x2019;t match up with any of the present orthodoxies.</p> <p> A reality-based, compassionate world is one in which criticism is okay. I dish it out, but I also lay my tender neck out before you.</p> <p><strong>Q. You&#x2019;re a musician in addition to being a computer scientist. What insight has that given you?</strong></p> <p><strong>A.</strong> In the 1990s I was signed to a big label, but as a minor artist. I had to compete in an esoteric niche market, as an experimental classical/jazz high prestige sort of artist. That world was highly competitive and professional, and inspired an intense level of effort from me.</p> <p> I assumed that losing the moneyed side of the recording business would not make all that much of a difference, but I was wrong. I no longer bother to release music. The reason is that it now feels like a vanity market. Self-promotion has become the primary activity of many of my musician friends. Yuk.</p> <p> When the music is heard, it&#x2019;s often in the context of automatically generated streams from some cloud service, so the listener doesn&#x2019;t even know it&#x2019;s you. Successful music tends to be quite conformist to some pre-existing category, because that way it fits better into the automatic streaming schemes. I miss competing in the intense NYC music scene. Who keeps you honest when the world is drowning in insincere flattery?</p> <p> So here I am writing books. Hello book critics!</p>Jaron Lanier is a scientist and musician best known for his work in Virtual Reality research, a term he coined and popularized. <i>Time</i> named him one of the &#x201c;<i>Time</i> 100&#x201d; in 2010. He lives in Berkeley, California.</p><h2>The Chill</h2><p>In <i>The Chill </i>a distraught young man hires private investigator Lew Archer to track down his runaway bride. But no sooner has he found Dolly Kincaid than Archer finds himself entangled in two murders, one twenty years old, the other so recent that the blood is still wet. What ensues is a detective novel of nerve-racking suspense, desperately believable characters, and one of the most intricate plots ever spun by an American crime writer.</p><p>"The surprise with which a detective novel concludes should set up tragic vibrations which run backward through the entire structure," wrote Ross Macdonald in his 1981 <i>Self-Portrait</i>. Nowhere in his work does he better demonstrate this principle than in <i>The Chill</i>, first published in 1964. The plot is one of Macdonald's most masterfully constructed. Private detective Lew Archer is engaged to trace a missing spouse, who has vanished--apparently of her own free will--only a day into her honeymoon. Archer begins pulling at the threads of the case, and by page 25 they're already starting to reveal a deeper, darker story involving two murders 20 years apart. As usual, Macdonald's economical prose propels the reader forward from one action-packed scene to another, while the scenes in turn pile up to paint a rich, complex picture of buried memories, anguished relations between parents and children, the arrogance of the rich, and the search for identity. Then, at the end, one of the author's best surprise reversals changes the picture's colors entirely. Even if you're one of those discerning readers who find Macdonald's lesser work superior to most other mystery writing (as does this reviewer), <i>The Chill</i> stands out among his books. <i>--Nicholas H. Allison</i>"The American private eye, immortalized by Hammett, refined by Chandler, brought to its zenith by MacDonald." --<b>The New York Times Book Review</b><br><br>"An entertainment of almost Byzantine complexity in which practically nothing is as the facts would seem. . . . Highly satisfactory." --<b>The New Yorker</b><br><br>"Lew Archer . . . is a crime-fighter of the old school; painstakingly searching out the twisting thread of suspense that leads him from the hint of one complicated drama to another." --<b>Christian Science Monitor</b></p><h2>Unaccustomed Earth</h2><p>From the internationally bestselling, Pulitzer Prize&#x2014;winning author, a superbly crafted new work of fiction: eight stories that take us from Cambridge and Seattle to India and Thailand.<br> &nbsp;<br>In the stunning title story, Ruma, a young mother in a new city, is visited by her father, who carefully tends the earth of her garden, where he and his grandson form a special bond. But he&#x2019;s harboring a secret from his daughter, a love affair he&#x2019;s keeping all to himself. In &#x201c;A Choice of Accommodations,&#x201d; a husband&#x2019;s attempt to turn an old friend&#x2019;s wedding into a romantic getaway weekend with his wife takes a dark, revealing turn as the party lasts deep into the night. In &#x201c;Only Goodness,&#x201d; a sister eager to give her younger brother the perfect childhood she never had is overwhelmed by guilt, anguish, and anger when his alcoholism threatens her family. And in &#x201c;Hema and Kaushik,&#x201d; a trio of linked stories&#x2013;a luminous, intensely compelling elegy of life, death, love, and fate&#x2013;we follow the lives of a girl and boy who, one winter, share a house in Massachusetts.

She lives in Brooklyn, New York.<b>Unaccustomed Earth</b><br><br>After her mother&#x2019;s death, Ruma&#x2019;s father retired from the pharmaceutical company where he had worked for many decades and began traveling in Europe, a continent he&#x2019;d never seen. In the past year he had visited France, Holland, and most recently Italy. They were package tours, traveling in the company of strangers, riding by bus through the countryside, each meal and museum and hotel prearranged. He was gone for two, three, sometimes four weeks at a time. When he was away Ruma did not hear from him. Each time, she kept the printout of his flight information behind a magnet on the door of the refrigerator, and on the days he was scheduled to fly she watched the news, to make sure there hadn&#x2019;t been a plane crash anywhere in the world.<br><br>Occasionally a postcard would arrive in Seattle, where Ruma and Adam and their son Akash lived. The postcards showed the facades of churches, stone fountains, crowded piazzas, terra-cotta rooftops mellowed by late afternoon sun. Nearly fifteen years had passed since Ruma&#x2019;s only European adventure, a month-long EuroRail holiday she&#x2019;d taken with two girlfriends after college, with money saved up from her salary as a para- legal. She&#x2019;d slept in shabby pensions, practicing a frugality that was foreign to her at this stage of her life, buying nothing but variations of the same postcards her father sent now. Her father wrote succinct, impersonal accounts of the things he had seen and done: &#x201c;Yesterday the Uffizi Gallery. Today a walk to the other side of the Arno. A trip to Siena scheduled tomorrow.&#x201d; Occasionally there was a sentence about the weather. But there was never a sense of her father&#x2019;s presence in those places. Ruma was reminded of the telegrams her parents used to send to their relatives long ago, after visiting Calcutta and safely arriving back in Pennsylvania.<br><br>The postcards were the first pieces of mail Ruma had received from her father. In her thirty-eight years he&#x2019;d never had any reason to write to her. It was a one-sided correspondence; his trips were brief enough so that there was no time for Ruma to write back, and besides, he was not in a position to receive mail on his end. Her father&#x2019;s penmanship was small, precise, slightly feminine; her mother&#x2019;s had been a jumble of capital and lowercase, as though she&#x2019;d learned to make only one version of each letter. The cards were addressed to Ruma; her father never included Adam&#x2019;s name, or mentioned Akash. It was only in his closing that he acknowledged any personal connection between them. &#x201c;Be happy, love Baba,&#x201d; he signed them, as if the attainment of happiness were as simple as that.<br><br>In August her father would be going away again, to Prague. But first he was coming to spend a week with Ruma and see the house she and Adam had bought on the Eastside of Seattle. They&#x2019;d moved from Brooklyn in the spring, for Adam&#x2019;s job. It was her father who suggested the visit, calling Ruma as she was making dinner in her new kitchen, surprising her. After her mother&#x2019;s death it was Ruma who assumed the duty of speaking to her father every evening, asking how his day had gone. The calls were less frequent now, normally once a week on Sunday afternoons. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re always welcome here, Baba,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d told her father on the phone. &#x201c;You know you don&#x2019;t have to ask.&#x201d; Her mother would not have asked. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re coming to see you in July,&#x201d; she would have informed Ruma, the plane tickets already in hand. There had been a time in her life when such presumptuousness would have angered Ruma. She missed it now.<br><br>Adam would be away that week, on another business trip. He worked for a hedge fund and since the move had yet to spend two consecutive weeks at home. Tagging along with him wasn&#x2019;t an option. He never went anywhere interesting&#x2014;usually towns in the Northwest or Canada where there was nothing special for her and Akash to do. In a few months, Adam assured her, the trips would diminish. He hated stranding Ruma with Akash so often, he said, especially now that she was pregnant again. He encouraged her to hire a babysitter, even a live-in if that would be helpful. But Ruma knew no one in Seattle, and the prospect of finding someone to care for her child in a strange place seemed more daunting than looking after him on her own. It was just a matter of getting through the summer&#x2014;in September, Akash would start at a preschool. Besides, Ruma wasn&#x2019;t working and couldn&#x2019;t justify paying for something she now had the freedom to do.<br><br>In New York, after Akash was born, she&#x2019;d negotiated a part-time schedule at her law firm, spending Thursdays and Fridays at home in Park Slope, and this had seemed like the perfect balance. The firm had been tolerant at first, but it had not been so easy, dealing with her mother&#x2019;s death just as an important case was about to go to trial. She had died on the operating table, of heart failure; anesthesia for routine gallstone surgery had triggered anaphylactic shock.<br><br>After the two weeks Ruma received for bereavement, she couldn&#x2019;t face going back. Overseeing her clients&#x2019; futures, preparing their wills and refinancing their mortgages, felt ridiculous to her, and all she wanted was to stay home with Akash, not just Thursdays and Fridays but every day. And then, miraculously, Adam&#x2019;s new job came through, with a salary generous enough for her to give notice. It was the house that was her work now: leafing through the piles of catalogues that came in the mail, marking them with Post-its, ordering sheets covered with dragons for Akash&#x2019;s room.<br><br>&#x201c;Perfect,&#x201d; Adam said, when Ruma told him about her father&#x2019;s visit. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be able to help you out while I&#x2019;m gone.&#x201d; But Ruma disagreed. It was her mother who would have been the helpful one, taking over the kitchen, singing songs to Akash and teaching him Bengali nursery rhymes, throwing loads of laundry into the machine. Ruma had never spent a week alone with her father. When her parents visited her in Brooklyn, after Akash was born, her father claimed an armchair in the living room, quietly combing through the <i>Times</i>, occasionally tucking a finger under the baby&#x2019;s chin but behaving as if he were waiting for the time to pass.<br><br>Her father lived alone now, made his own meals. She could not picture his surroundings when they spoke on the phone. He&#x2019;d moved into a one-bedroom condominium in a part of Pennsylvania Ruma did not know well. He had pared down his possessions and sold the house where Ruma and her younger brother Romi had spent their childhood, informing them only after he and the buyer went into contract. It hadn&#x2019;t made a difference to Romi, who&#x2019;d been living in New Zealand for the past two years, working on the crew of a German documentary filmmaker. Ruma knew that the house, with the rooms her mother had decorated and the bed in which she liked to sit up doing crossword puzzles and the stove on which she&#x2019;d cooked, was too big for her father now. Still, the news had been shocking, wiping out her mother&#x2019;s presence just as the surgeon had.<br><br>She knew her father did not need taking care of, and yet this very fact caused her to feel guilty; in India, there would have been no question of his not moving in with her. Her father had never mentioned the possibility, and after her mother&#x2019;s death it hadn&#x2019;t been feasible; their old apartment was too small. But in Seattle there were rooms to spare, rooms that stood empty and without purpose.<br><br>Ruma feared that her father would become a responsibility, an added demand, continuously present in a way she was no longer used to. It would mean an end to the family she&#x2019;d created on her own: herself and Adam and Akash, and the second child that would come in January, conceived just before the move. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine tending to her father as her mother had, serving the meals her mother used to prepare. Still, not offering him a place in her home made her feel worse. It was a dilemma Adam didn&#x2019;t understand. Whenever she brought up the issue, he pointed out the obvious, that she already had a small child to care for, another on the way. He reminded her that her father was in good health for his age, content where he was. But he didn&#x2019;t object to the idea of her father living with them. His willingness was meant kindly, generously, an example of why she loved Adam, and yet it worried her. Did it not make a difference to him? She knew he was trying to help, but at the same time she sensed that his patience was wearing thin. By allowing her to leave her job, splurging on a beautiful house, agreeing to having a second baby, Adam was doing everything in his power to make Ruma happy. But nothing was making her happy; recently, in the course of conversation, he&#x2019;d pointed that out, too.<br>How freeing it was, these days, to travel alone, with only a single suitcase to check. He had never visited the Pacific Northwest, never appreciated the staggering breadth of his adopted land. He had flown across America only once before, the time his wife booked tickets to Calcutta on Royal Thai Airlines, via Los Angeles, rather than traveling east as they normally did. That journey was endless, four seats, he still remembered, among the smokers at the very back of the plane. None of them had the energy to visit any sights in Bangkok during their layover, sleeping instead in the hotel provided by the airline. His wife, who had been most excited to see the Floating Market, slept even through dinner, for he remembered a meal in the hotel with only Romi and Ruma, in a solarium overlooking a garden, tasting the spiciest food he&#x2019;d ever had in his life as mosquitoes swarmed angrily behind his children&#x2019;s faces. No matter how they went, those trips to India were always epic, and he still recalled the anxiety they provoked in him, having to pack so much luggage and getting it all to the airport, keeping documents in order and ferrying his family safely so many thousands of miles. But his wife had lived for these journeys, and until both his parents died, a part of him lived for them, too. And so they&#x2019;d gone in spite of the expense, in spite of the sadness and shame he felt each time he returned to Calcutta, in spite of the fact that the older his children grew, the less they wanted to go.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Golden Men: The Power of Gay Midlife</h2><p><p>Perhaps nowhere is the American obsession with beauty and glorification of youth more prevalent than in gay male culture.

Here, in THE SUNDERED WORLDS, THE FIRECLOWN and THE TWILIGHT MAN, the multiverse is introduced and various aspects of the eternal champion, Moorcock&#39;s great and enduring creation, are explored. In THE FIRECLOWN, a totalitarian regime is enraged by the appearance of the fireclown, a man from the lower levels of the great city whose pyroclastic displays threaten to enflame the subdued population. In THE SUNDERED WORLDS, we are introduced to the concept of the multiverse, as Count Renark von Bek seeks to save the human race from the collapse of the universe itself. And in THE TWILIGHT MAN, the last man born on earth dares to leave for the stars, in search of a cure for the malaise inflicting the remaining members of mankind.</p><p>Michael Moorcock (1939-) Michael Moorcock is one of the most important figures in British SF and Fantasy literature. The author of many literary novels and stories in practically every genre, his novels have won and been shortlisted for numerous awards including the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Whitbread and Guardian Fiction Prize. In 1999, he was given the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award; in 2001, he was inducted into the SF Hall of Fame; and in 2007, he was named a SFWA Grandmaster. Michael Moorcock is also a musician who has performed since the seventies with his own band, the Deep Fix; and, as a member of the prog rock band, Hawkwind, won a gold disc.

He lives in Dorset and travels widely.<p>PART I</p><p>The Wolf in the Palace</p><p>1</p><p>STORM FROM THE EAST</p><p>Tuscany, early August 408</p><p>A bright dawn was breaking over the sun-baked plains beside the River Arno. Around the walls of the grim frontier town of Florentia, the exhausted remnants of Rhadagastus&#x2019;s barbarian army were awakening, to find themselves no longer surrounded by the implacable legionaries of Rome. Slowly, uncertainly, and with a defeated air, they began to break camp and make for the hills to the north.</p><p>On another hill to the south, commanding a fine view of the retreat, and surveying the scene with some satisfaction, sat two Roman officers on horse back, resplendent in breastplates of bronze and plumes of scarlet.</p><p>"Shall I give the order, sir?" said the younger of the two.</p><p>General Stilicho kept his gaze on the unfolding scene below. "Thank you, Tribune, but I shall do it myself when good and ready." Impertinent puppy, he thought, with your bought commission and your unscarred limbs.</p><p>From far below arose clouds of dust, partially obscuring the sight of the barbarians&#x2019; great wooden wagons as they creaked and rolled out of the camp and made their way northward. The two Roman officers on the hill could hear the crack of bullwhips and the cries of men as this motley and vagabond army of Vandals and Sueves, renegade Goths, Lombards, and Franks, began its long retreat back beyond the Alpine passes to their tribal homelands.</p><p>Rome would survive their attentions a little longer yet.</p><p>Rhadagastus&#x2019;s ferocious horde of Germanic warriors had been united only in their lust for gold, and their fierce delight in destruction. They had cut a crimson swathe across half of Europe, from their homelands on the cold Baltic shores, or out on the vast Scythian steppes, to the vineyards of Provence and the golden hills of Tuscany, until they eventually came to a halt at the city of Florentia. Once there, they besieged that sternly fortified colony of Rome on the banks of the Arno. But the great General Stilicho, as imperturbable as ever, rode north from Rome to meet them, with an army perhaps only a fifth the size of Rhadagastus&#x2019;s&#x2014;but an army trained in the arts of siege craft as well as war.</p><p>As is so often said, for every day that a Roman soldier wields a sword, he spends a hundred days wielding a shovel. No one digs a trench like a Roman soldier. And soon the besiegers of the city found themselves in turn besieged. The surrounding army, though fewer in number, had access to vital supplies from the nearby country, to food and water, fresh horses, and even new weaponry. The surrounded army, however, forcibly enclosed in its camp under the heat of the Tuscan August sun, was in no better circumstances than Florentia itself. The trapped barbarians had no resources they could draw on, and slowly began to expire.</p><p>In desperation, the frustrated and stricken Germans threw themselves against the barriers that surrounded them, but to no avail. Their horses shied and whinnied, hooves cruelly pierced by the iron caltrops the Romans had scattered across the hard-baked ground, throwing their furious riders beneath the unyielding entrenchments and ramparts, where they were soon despatched by archers up on the embankment. Those who tried to attack their besiegers on foot found themselves having to descend into a ditch six feet in depth, and then struggle out the far side, an equal climb, and up against three lines of wicked sharpened staves. Behind them were lined the Roman spearmen with their long, thrusting javelins. It was an impossible barrier. Those barbarians not slain on the barricades returned to their tents and lay down in exhaustion and despair.</p><p>When Stilicho reckoned Rhadagastus had lost as much as a third of his forces, he gave the order for the Romans to break camp in the night and withdraw into the surrounding hills. And so now, as dawn broke, the baffled and exhausted northern tribes found themselves free to move off as well&#x2014;homeward.</p><p>Nevertheless, once they were rolling and in thorough disorder, it would be good to send in the new auxiliaries and see what they could do. Stilicho took no fine pleasure in seeing men cut down on a battlefield&#x2014;unlike some generals he could mention. But the vast and undisciplined rabble below, which that troublesome warlord Rhadagastus had pulled together for the summer campaigning season, remained a threat to Rome&#x2019;s northern borders, even in defeat. A final harrying attack from these new mounted troops, however lightweight, would certainly do no harm.</p><p>At last, with the barbarian army chaotically strung out across the plain, and its vanguard nudging into the foothills to the north, General Stilicho gave the nod.</p><p>"Send them in," he said.</p><p>His tribune relayed the signal down the line, and only moments later Stilicho saw with some surprise that the auxiliaries had already started their gallop.</p><p>Not that he expected much from them. They were small men, these new warriors from the east, and lightly armed. They favored their neat bows and arrows over all other weapons, and even rode into battle with lassos&#x2014;as if about to ride down a bunch of sleepy-eyed heifers! Who ever won a battle with mere rope? And Rhadagastus&#x2019;s warriors, even in defeat, were no sleepy-eyed heifers.</p><p>As well as being small and lightly armed, these horse men fought without armor, naked to the waist, with only a fine coating of dust over their coppery, leathery skins for protection. They would do little damage to the retreating army, it was clear, but it would be interesting to see them in action, all the same. No Roman had yet seen them fight, although many had heard vainglorious and unlikely reports of their prowess at arms. They were said to move fast on their shaggy little steppe ponies, so perhaps some use could be found for them in future in the imperial courier ser vice . . . With luck, they might even manage to ride down Rhadagastus himself, and bring him in as a captive. It was a long bow shot, but worth a try.</p><p>Well, reports of their impressive turn of speed, at any rate, had not been exaggerated.</p><p>The horsemen came thundering out from a shallow valley to the east, and made straight for the stricken column of retreating barbarians. Good enough tactics: the sun behind them, and straight in their enemies&#x2019; eyes. Stilicho was too far away to see the expressions on the faces of Rhadagastus&#x2019;s men, of course, but the way the column slowed, and jostled, and the air filled with panicked cries, and then the heavy wagons lurched desperately forward again, trying to make for the safety of the rough ground and the hills before the furious charge of the eastern horse men could hit them&#x2014;such things told him Rhadagastus&#x2019;s warriors weren&#x2019;t smiling.</p><p>The horsemen&#x2019;s thunderous charge drummed up a fine dust from the sun-baked late-summer plains, and Stilicho and his tribune strained to see. Then something darkened the air between them. At first they could barely comprehend.</p><p>"Is that . . . Is that what I think it is, sir?"</p><p>Stilicho was dumbfounded. It was indeed what it seemed. The very air was dark with them. An unimaginable storm of arrows.</p><p>He had heard that these people were good on horseback; and he had heard good things of their unprepossessing little bows. But nothing had prepared him for this.</p><p>The arrows fell in an endless rain, like murderous stinging insects, upon Rhadagastus&#x2019;s outflanked column, and the stricken Germans began to grind to a halt, their path blocked by the piled-up corpses of their own men. Then the horsemen, the fury of their charge undiminished even after covering a mile or more of hard, sunbaked ground&#x2014;long after a troop of Roman cavalry would have begun to slacken and tire&#x2014;scythed into the aghast and petrified column.</p><p>Both Stilicho and his tribune had their fists bunched up on the pommels of their saddles, pushing themselves up and straining to see.</p><p>"In the Name of Light," murmured the general.</p><p>"Have you ever seen anything like it, sir?" said the tribune.</p><p>The horsemen cut through the column in seconds, then, with unbelievable dexterity, wheeled round and cut in again from the other side. Rhadagastus&#x2019;s warriors, even after their weeks of starvation and sickness under the walls of Florentia, were now trying to establish some kind of formation and repel the attack. These tall, blond spearmen, these fierce and skilful swordsmen, fought back with the ferocity of the doomed. But the ferocity of their attackers was greater. Nearer to where they sat their horses, the two Roman officers could see breakaway groups of mounted auxiliaries wheeling and turning about as if with pure delight, effortlessly slaughtering the helpless, milling Germans. And they also saw the deadly effect of the easterners&#x2019; lassos. Any barbarian who tried to mount up and ride was instantly brought down again by the whistle and lash of the cruel noose, cast with terrible, casual accuracy. The victim fell in a tangle of reins and limbs, and was quickly despatched where he lay.</p><p>Stilicho watched with amazement as the horsemen, even up close, long after Roman cavalry would have drawn their longswords, continued to use their short bows and arrows. He could now see, as the fighting spread out in disorder below them, why their fighting skill was so renowned. He watched a single horseman notch an arrow to his bow, fire it into the back of a fleeing German, and snatch another arrow from his quiver as he swung round on his horse&#x2019;s bare back. He notched it, leaned down at an incredible angle to take cover alongside the body of his mount, holding on with his thigh muscles alone, then sprang back up and loosed another arrow almost into the face of a German running at him with ax swinging. The arrow punched straight through and came out of the back of the axman&#x2019;s head in a spew of blood and brain. The horse man had notched another arrow to his bow and galloped on before the warrior hit the ground.</p><p>Galloped! The en...</p></p><h2>Complete Fiction of W. M. Spackman (American Literature (Dalkey Archive))</h2><p><p>Described by Stanley Elkin as "this country's best-kept literary secret" and "a lost American classic," W. M. Spackman is one of the finest writers of the twentieth century.</p><p>This omnibus edition includes all five of the author's previously published novels: "Heyday" (and here presented with revisions the author made shortly before his death); and the critically acclaimed novels published between 1978 and 1985: "An Armful of Warm Girl" (1978), "A Presence with Secrets" (1980), "A Difference of Design" (1983), and "A Little Decorum, for Once" (1985). The novel "As I Sauntered Out, One Midcentury Morning" is published here for the first time, as well as the author's only two short stories.</p></p><p>Spackman published his first novel, Heyday, in 1953. Although he soon after left his position as a classics professor to devote himself to writing, his second novel, An Armful of Warm Girl, did not find a publisher until 1978, when Spackman was 72. That may have been because the book, featuring a dapper, randy, upper-class protagonist and the various well-to-do women with whom he has affairs--its amours described in an elegant, droll prose, and its view of adultery unsettlingly lighthearted--seemed so unlike anything else being written. The novel was sufficiently successful to allow Spackman to keep publishing: In quick succession the A Presence with Secrets, A Difference of Design, and A Little Decorum, For Once (all sharing the confectionary prose and worldly wise esprit of Armful) were issued. A sixth novel, As I Sauntered Out, One Midcentury Morning, was in manuscript when Spackman died in 1990. All are assembled here, along with two short pieces, in a welcome gathering of the work of one of the most idiosyncratic, provocative, and intensely stylish American writers of recent decades. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Spackman (1905-90), an American, is known by serious readers as a great stylist, a quality prominently displayed in this gathering of his five published novels and one unpublished and two short stories. Elegant, witty, and urbane, Spackman's fiction presents achingly beautiful and never less than scintillating depictions of the psychology of love and sexual attraction.

But it was also becoming a city of greed, where both life's consolations and its necessities were increasingly going to the highest bidder. <i>At the Strangers' Gate</i> builds a portrait of this particular moment in New York through the story of this couple's journey--from their excited arrival as aspiring artists to their eventual growth into a New York family. Gopnik transports us to his tiny basement room on the Upper East Side, and later to SoHo, where he captures a unicorn: an affordable New York loft. He takes us through his professional meanderings, from graduate student-cum-library-clerk to the corridors of Condï¿½ Nast and the galleries of MoMA. Between tender and humorous reminiscences, including affectionate portraits of Richard Avedon, Robert Hughes, and Jeff Koons, among many others, Gopnik discusses the ethics of ambition, the economy of creative capital, and the peculiar anthropology of art and aspiration in New York, then and now.</p><p><b>ADAM GOPNIK</b> has been writing for <i>The New Yorker </i>since 1986.

(Years later, when I was writing &#x201c;Talk of the Town&#x201d; for <i>The New Yorker</i>, I would interview one of The Andrews Sisters about Bing Crosby: &#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t kid him a lot,&#x201d; she said warily. &#x201c;But you could kid him a <i>little</i>.&#x201d; It depended on the angle that he wore his hat. Life, it occurred to me, is like Bing Crosby, its moods indicated by the pressures of the time, like that hat. That morning, the hat was on at just the right angle.)<br> &nbsp;<br> Years later still, when she was pregnant, Martha, the girl I married that morning, made me promise not to go to a bookstore while she was in labor. As it happened, the labor was drawn out, and, wanting to avoid an argument with the obnoxious obstetrician, I took a break during hour six, and did end up in a bookstore around the corner from the hospital. It was a good move. Martha was so panicked by my absence&#x2014;with the constant noise of ambulances arriving at the emergency entrance nearby, she easily imagined some tragic-karmic accident&#x2014;that she dilated. I arrived just in time for the birth of our son, and carrying a wonderful copy of Santayana&#x2019;s <i>The Sense of Beauty</i>, which, I swear, I really did intend to read aloud to her, if things had gone on any longer.<br> &nbsp;<br> But that, as I said, was years later&#x2014;actually, only a few, as older people reckon these things, but at the time, what would stretch to a decade seemed a lifetime. It <i>was</i> a lifetime.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I say &#x201c;married in New York&#x201d; I know that it might sound rather like top hats and morning coats and a ceremony at St. Thomas Episcopal. In fact, on a bleak December day, we would take the 5 train to City Hall, with a license and blood test results in hand, and submit to a minute-and-a-half-long ceremony administered by an official who looked a bit like Don Ameche in his guise as host of <i>International Circus</i> from my childhood. And so, after approximately forty-five further seconds of obligation and vows, we took the subway back to the nine-by-eleven basement room where we were beginning our life, a place that we had dubbed &#x201c;the Blue Room,&#x201d; in honor of an old Rodgers &amp; Hart song that I was insane enough to remember, and that Martha was insane enough to accept as a guide to living. The song was about a couple who choose a &#x201c;blue room,&#x201d; a single studio where they can start their life: &#x201c;Not like a ballroom, / A small room, / A hall room . . .&#x201d; Away from everyone else, in the smallest studio in Manhattan, they were happy.<br> &nbsp;<br> The subway trip downtown was, in a way, only an extension of a trip south we had begun a few months before in Canada, getting on a bus marked &#x201c;New York City,&#x201d; like something out of a 1940s musical. My father saw us off. Fathers are supposed to give advice to young men and women leaving the provinces for the metropolis. D&#x2019;Artagnan&#x2019;s father in <i>The Three Musketeers</i> tells him to fight duels with everyone once he gets to Paris&#x2014;sensible advice for a guy with a sword who knows how to use it. When Sky Masterson&#x2014;you know, the hero of <i>Guys and Dolls</i>&#x2014;leaves Colorado for New York, <i>his</i> father tells him that if a guy in the big city shows you a brandnew deck of cards, seal unbroken, and wants to bet that when he opens it the jack of hearts <i>will</i> leap out and squirt cider in your ear, don&#x2019;t take that bet: the jack will leap out and start to squirt. That is to say, in the big city, nobody makes an apparently crazy bet if the deck isn&#x2019;t already gaffed. (This is, of course, a corollary to the famous advice that if you&#x2019;re sitting at a card table and can&#x2019;t figure out who the sucker is, you&#x2019;re the sucker.)<br> &nbsp;<br> My father&#x2019;s advice when I left Canada for New York was simple: &#x201c;Never underestimate the other person&#x2019;s insecurity.&#x201d; This was excellent counsel, and what trouble I would get into came mostly from forgetting it. Everyone, even the apparently powerful, is struggling inside with a raging fear of being unloved, or at least unappreciated, an emotion only magnified by the enormity of the city. Thinking it over decades later, I suspect my father was getting at the real point of Sky Masterson&#x2019;s dad&#x2019;s advice about not taking the bet on the squirting jacks, or its corollary, anyway: everybody at the table may be a sucker. The guy with the gaffed deck is playing with a gaffed deck because he doesn&#x2019;t think he can win with one that isn&#x2019;t. Even the wise guys are most often suckers inside, or feel like it. That&#x2019;s what makes them insecure. It is the dapper and self-contained card sharp who is the illusion of the card table&#x2014;or the city<br> &nbsp;<br> My father spoke in the summer of 1980. I arrived in New York that August, and the next ten years of my life were big ones. But I was twenty when I got here, so they would have been big for me if I had spent them at a recording station in the Arctic Circle. With the special energy that we have when we first arrive in a new place, Martha and I diligently explored all the odd corners of the city. We inspected what seemed like every navigable inch of Central Park, going in and out of all the gates that Olmsted and Vaux had named, poetically, when they designed it, with the Strangers&#x2019; Gate, up at 106th and Central Park West, having for us a special resonance. We were strangers, and we had arrived, and we dreamt of becoming citizens.<br> &nbsp;<br> **<br> &nbsp;<br> Almost forty years on, the eighties in New York seem momentous in the larger life of the world, too. Forty years is the natural gestation time of nostalgia, the interval it takes for a past period to become a lost time, and, sometimes, a golden age. There&#x2019;s a simple reason to explain why. Everybody&#x2019;s shocking first intimation of the setting sun&#x2014;which takes about forty years to happen&#x2014;inspires a look back at the sun rising, and its imagined light makes everything from then look golden. Though pop culture is most often performed by the young, the directors and programmers and gatekeepers&#x2014; the suits who control and create the conditions, who make the calls and choose the players&#x2014;are, and always have been, largely forty-somethings. The four-decade interval brings us back roughly to a point when they were becoming aware of themselves. Forty years ago is the potently fascinating time when we were just arriving, when our parents were youthful and in love, the Edenic period preceding the fallen state recorded in our actual memories.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet the eighties, though once again a set subject, still bear more disapproval than it seems quite fair to load on any past time. Their light shines in retrospect more brassy yellow than truly gold and generous. The time gets summed up in a phrase no one actually said: Greed is good. Greed was, perhaps, more unapologetic at the time than it had ever been before. It was not so much that we experienced capitalism with the gloves off as capitalism without guilt, or, to put it another way, without a conscience. A lot of people got rich and had no shame about it, along the way remaking the city in their image.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, the truth is that no period or place belongs to the neat summaries of popular history. Moods don&#x2019;t change so readily; lives aren&#x2019;t lived in such neatly determined packages. We live as much in defiance of the popular themes as in thrall to them. The headlines are of no help when we&#x2019;re making up our own epitaphs. When I think of the eighties I can recall one or two shimmering nights when rich men did rule, but I recall more mornings when having a pair of sneakers and a Walkman seemed to mark one most as a lover of his time. History and experience still are measured out on separate cutting boards. We know that, exactly, by how badly they fit each other. When we put on our period clothes, so to speak, the pants puddle and the waist tugs and the jacket won&#x2019;t quite button up. The adjustments that have to be made are the proof of how off the measurements are in memory. I used to tell my readers, during the part of the eighties I spent giving anonymous advice as a fashion copywriter, that God is in the details, or that a love for the details is what takes the place of God. I said this to the readers of a men&#x2019;s fashion magazine, who must have been startled to find such chewy aphoristic atheism in its pages&#x2014;or, rather, not &#x201c;readers,&#x201d; since they were, as intended, too busy looking at the pants. The zippers of experience and the broad cut of history never quite fit.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, something did change then. Not human nature, perhaps, something more like the national character. In the eighties in New York all the bounds of money began to loosen. At the same time, most of the certainties that rich people once had about sex and life and marriage and roles that people played came to an end. Most notions of equality dissolved, but so did most notions of gentility. The tandem effect is still baffling to a lot of people, who thought it had all along been the gentility perpetuating the inequalities, instead of the other way round. In 1961, Lenny Bruce was arrested and martyred for saying &#x201c;cocksucker&#x201d; in a nightclub in California. By the time Ronald Reagan was President, anyone could say &#x201c;cocksucker&#x201d; in any nightclub in California; or, rather, by the time you could say &#x201c;cocksucker&#x201d; in any nightclub in California, Ronald Reagan was President. Sorting out the contradictions&#x2014;or at least living within them tolerably&#x2014;is part of the work of getting the era.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why, in a city ruled by brutal materialism, did things seem increasingly unreal? One answer was that the buying and selling had become so abstract that only unreal signs could represent them. Money had always meant a lot. Now some thought that money meant <i>everything</i>, that only money had weight in the world. Others thought that now money <i>meant</i> everything. Not just that everything had been pushed aside for the pursuit of money but that even what remained as art or music had no way of getting itself expressed except <i>through</i> money&#x2014;or some fluid that represented it. Jeff Koons&#x2019;s art was like this. Money wasn&#x2019;t just its subject. Money was its essence&#x2014;or was supposed to be. The cold, dead hand of the commodity was not to be juiced or colored or mocked or made to look religious&#x2014;&#x201c;iconic,&#x201d; to use that awful word&#x2014;as it had in the age of Warhol. It was all there was. Money had pushed every other value aside. Money was indistinguishable from art. Koons&#x2019;s silver bunny was the demon of our time: once a plaything, now encased in bullion, ridiculous and sinister and cold. Money had made itself into art.<br> &nbsp;<br> This was false, of course. As long as mortality exists, money will be mocked. You really <i>can&#x2019;t</i> take it with you. There were plenty of things that money couldn&#x2019;t mean. (Jeff Koons, encountered one time on the street, wept for a son taken from him, whom no amount could summon back or replace; later, I would also see the critic Robert Hughes, Koons&#x2019;s bï¿½te noire, weep on the same street for his own lost son.) But those things led a more furtive or vestigial life.<br> &nbsp;<br> I had the sense of another divide taking shape, one harder to see but just as important. To myself, I called it &#x201c;The Blue Room and the Big Store,&#x201d; and even thought already then of writing a book with that title. The world was getting blowsier and bigger and harder to capture; the counter-life was taking place in smaller and smaller rooms. It took place in stranger and stranger subcultures, in more bizarre and eccentric existences, lived more marginally than before. This made for a kind of broken disjunction between public life and private experience.</p><h2>Anthony Blunt: His Lives</h2><p><b>The first full biography of the notorious spy</b>&#x2014;<b>and an X-ray of the British ruling class that produced him.</b><br><br>Once an untouchable member of England's establishment&#x2014;a world-famous art historian and a man knighted by the Queen of England&#x2014;in a single stroke Anthony Blunt became an object of universal hatred when, in 1979, Margaret Thatcher exposed him as a Soviet spy.<br><br>In <i>Anthony Blunt: His Lives</i>, Miranda Carter shows how one man lived out opposing trends of his century&#x2014;first as a rebel against his class, then as its epitome&#x2014;and yet embodied a deeper paradox. In the 1920s, Blunt was a member of the Bloomsbury circle; in the 1930s he was a left-wing intellectual; in the 50s and 60s he became a camouflaged member of the Establishment. Until his treachery was made public, Blunt was a world-famous art historian, recognized for his ground-breaking work on Poussin, Italian art, and old master drawings; at the Courtauld Institute he trained a whole generation of academics and curators. And yet even as he ascended from rebellion into outward conformity, he was a homosexual when homosexuality was a crime, and a traitor when the penalty was death. <br><br>How could one man contain so many contradictions? The layers of secrecy upon which Blunt's life depended are here stripped away for the first time, using testimony from those who knew Blunt well but have until now kept silent and documents from sealed Russian archives, including a secret autobiography Blunt wrote for his controllers. Miranda Carter's <i>Anthony Blunt</i> is the first full biography of the mythical Cold War warrior, and is at once an astonishing history of one the century's greatest deceits and a deeply nuanced account of fifty years in the British power elite, as experienced by one deep inside who wished to bring it down. <br></p><p><b>Miranda Carter</b> was educated at St Paul's Girls' School and Exeter College, Oxford. She worked as a publisher and journalist before beginning research on her biography of Anthony Blunt in 1994. She lives in London with her husband and son. This is her first book. <br><b>Prologue</b><br><br>From the moment of his exposure as a former Russian spy by the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, in November 1979, Anthony Blunt became a man about whom anything could be said. <br><br>He was described as 'the spy with no shame'. He was 'an arrogant evil poseur'. He was a 'treacherous Communist poof '. It was rumoured that at Cambridge he had seduced and blackmailed impressionable undergraduates into serving his nefarious schemes. He had been responsible for the deaths of forty-nine wartime Dutch Special Operations agents behind enemy lines; he might, indeed, have been responsible for any number of deaths. He had been involved in devious conspiracies with Louis Mountbatten&#x2014;possibly to put Mountbatten's relatives on the thrones of Europe after the Second World War. He had salted away a fortune abroad. He had brought about the suicide of one of his students, Virginia Lee. He had been a predatory homosexual, or even a paedophile with links to the Kincora children's home scandal in Northern Ireland; he had blackmailed the Establishment into granting him immunity from prosecution by threatening to reveal proof that the Duke of Windsor had been plotting with the Nazis during the Second World War; he had been an authenticator of forgeries, and had connived with the French picture dealer Georges Wildenstein to sell a fake Georges de la Tour to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; he had stolen the credit for a book on Picasso from a pupil and colleague, Phoebe Pool; he had borrowed money from his friend Victor Rothschild to buy a Poussin, and never repaid it; he had cheated the elderly Duncan Grant out of a Poussin he had owned, subsequently using his influence to get an export licence to sell the picture at a hugely inflated price to a gallery in Canada; he had engineered the Courtauld Institute's move to Somerset House in the Strand in order to deprive the country of a Turner museum, as part of a fiendish plot to 'relegate British art to a secondary position'.<br><br>After his exposure, Blunt became a kind of screen on which fiction and fantasy were projected. There was little he could do about this. After the publication of one of the more extravagant stories he asked his lawyer, Michael Rubinstein, if he had any legal recourse, and was told that he did not: he had lost his good name, and it would therefore be impossible to sue for libel. He had in effect so defamed himself that no further defamation was possible. <br><br>1That was one of the main factors which helped to obscure the truth about Blunt after his downfall. Another was his sheer usefulness as a hate figure. At the time of his exposure the Cold War had led to a polarization of intellectual and political life so absolute that it was entirely taken for granted by all participants. For the Right in Britain, invigorated by Mrs Thatcher's victory in the general election of May 1979, Blunt was the apotheosis of a particular species of privileged, ungrateful, over-educated, unpatriotic, left-wing intellectual&#x2014;and homosexual to boot. He embodied the hypocrisy of a liberal class which gave thanks for its inherited freedoms by betraying them. The press harped on about the naturally lax, relativistic morals of intellectuals and their automatic assumption that they were better than anyone else; these were the obvious reasons for Blunt's misdeeds. 'Less intellectual people have simpler ideas and more direct instincts,' one Thatcherite intellectual wrote. Blunt became defined as a caricature of his class (privileged, therefore overindulged), his calling (academic, therefore elitist and snobbish) and his sexual orientation (homosexual, therefore predatory and wedded to secrets). Sometimes the results were unintentionally hilarious: Mask of Treachery, a prurient, feverishly homophobic, wildly fantastical (if interminable - at 761 pages) spy biography by the late journalist-turned-'contemporary historian' John Costello was subtitled in the USA 'Lies, Spies, Buggery and Betrayal'. The caricature continues to this day: 'Pampered with an upper class education and a comfortable lifestyle,' runs one entry for Blunt in a recent internet history of espionage, 'Anthony Blunt embraced espionage as easily as he would later accept the honours of the country he betrayed. An arrogant intellectual Blunt put himself and his ideas above his loyalty to England. Like most of his class, he felt himself superior to the concept of nations.' <br><br>There were other things that could have been said about Blunt; at the time, his friends were reluctant to say them. Many of these friends were in a dilemma. They had no wish to join the rush to public condemnation, but at the same time they were not keen to speak up on Blunt's behalf. For one thing, the torrent of public abuse was so overwhelming that any countervailing voices were drowned out: the publication of one former student's letter of support in The Times led to his denunciation for 'moral blindness', and death threats. For another thing, many of Blunt's friends felt personally betrayed by him. He had lied to them, systematically and without any apparent compunction, for as long as he had known them. Even for those who were by no stretch of the imagination Cold Warriors, the fact that he had passed secrets to the Soviet Union at a time when it was allied with Nazi Germany created no strong wish to enter the lists publicly on his behalf. <br><br>The fact that Blunt had been a spy, of course, muddied the waters from the start. Espionage seems naturally to attract conspiracy theorists and fantasists; but even serious would-be chroniclers have for the most part been forced to rely&#x2014;in the absence of reliable information from British Intelligence&#x2014;on the fallible, sometimes deliberately misleading, and often entirely self-serving memories of former Intelligence officers. In the last few years the Russian Intelligence Archives have made available more information about Blunt and his fellow spies, but they have kept the publication of material under careful control, making their information available only to those whom they choose&#x2014;notably former KGB officers, the relatives of former KGB officers and former Cold Warrior spy writers. (It is a peculiar irony that, since the end of the Cold War, these spy writers and former KGB officers have found they have more in common with each other than with anyone else.) They have also given no indication of how complete their disclosures are. In this field, no one with information gives it without a strong reason, and the first question to ask of any revelation is always, cui bono? <br><br>The factor which most persistently kept Blunt a mystery, however, was his own fundamental mysteriousness, the fact that even to his friends he was an enigma. They were well aware that there were many things they did not know about him. 'I worked with him for thirty years, but I never felt I really knew him,' his deputy director at the Courtauld Institute of Art, George Zarnecki, said later. There were plenty of others who felt the same way. This was no accident. Blunt had spent much of his life in flight from being known and understood. He was a habitual compartmentalizer and withdrawer from the world. In contrast to the volumes of emotional autobiographical memoir left by the Bloomsbury Group&#x2014;whom he knew and by whom he was fascinated in his early youth&#x2014;Blunt left extraordinarily few permanent personal traces of himself. It was as if he had spent years trying to excise himself from the record. His letters were almost always undated and almost always empty of personal detail; his 'official' communications to his staff at the Courtauld were as ephemeral as it was possible to be, scribbled in the lightest pencil on torn scraps of paper. His prose style was as cool and impersonal as he could make it. His few attempts at memoir were exasperatingly pedestrian and clumsy, as if the effort of examining and explaining himself was both alien and discomfiting. Even in the face of total condemnation and loss of reputation, he resisted the urge to explain. After his exposure he gave one press conference, in which his evasions -- some real, some apparent&#x2014;merely fed the media's appetite for a monster. He seldom spoke about the matter again, and virtually never appeared in public. <br><br>Twenty-two years after Blunt's exposure, much has changed. Perhaps the most important of all these changes has been the end of the Cold War. The ideological polarizations which divided almost all political and intellectual life, in Britain as elsewhere, have eased. Blunt's history can be seen in its particularity, rather than as an exemplary (to many, exemplarily hateful) general case. From this new perspective, his life vividly illustrates certain key moments and themes of twentieth-century Britain: intellectual, political, sexual and social. Blunt was a public-school rebel of a near-textbook type; in the 1920s he became a follower of Bloomsbury; in the 1930s a left-wing intellectual; in the 1950s and '60s an impeccably camouflaged man of the Establishment. He turned the Courtauld Institute into a famous centre for research into art history. He was a great teacher who trained a generation of world-class curators and academics. He played a central role in restoring the reputation of the French painter Nicolas Poussin; he wrote several ground-breaking books on French art and architecture and baroque art, and was for decades the most powerful and influential man in British art history. He was homosexual in a world where homosexuality was against the law, and a traitor at a time when the penalty for the crime was death. <br><br>Three other factors have made a biography of Blunt possible. One of them is that his friends and colleagues&#x2014;for the most part&#x2014;came to forgive or to comprehend or to put in context his spying, and became willing to talk about their memories of him. It would not have been possible to write this book without these testimonies, which I make no apology for stressing throughout my account of Blunt.

"In Seville different histories were superimposed and interdependent," he writes, aided by Sonia Soto's seamless translation. "A rosary stringing together time, blood and prayers in different languages beneath a blue sky and wise sun that leveled everything over the centuries. Stone survivors that could still be heard. You just had to forget for a moment the camcorders, postcards, coaches full of tourists and cheeky young girls, and put your ear to the stones and listen." As in his previous surprise bestsellers--<i>The Club Dumas</i> and <i>The Flanders Panel</i>, both available in paperback--Perez-Reverte takes a supposedly cool observer and turns the person into a hot-blooded participant in the action. In <i>The Seville Communion</i> it's Father Lorenzo Quart, who works for an investigative branch of the Vatican that is referred to by an angry, upstaged Archbishop of Seville as "you and your mafiosi in Rome, playing God's police." Father Quart, a very attractive man with prematurely gray hair cropped short, wears expensive suits and has to fight off the women who test his vows of celibacy. His toughest challenge is a breathtaking, titled beauty named Macarena, whose banker husband is at the center of a plot to tear down a historic church. Two people have already been killed because of the intrigue, and more violence threatens as Father Quart is pursued by a trio of ineptly dangerous villains, straight out of Bogart's <i>Beat the Devil</i>, through the gorgeous streets of a city to die for.Published in paperback by Harcourt, 1999, 0-15-600639-1 <br>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 1998, 0-15-100283-5 <br></p><h2>New Japan Architecture: Recent Works by the World&#39;s Leading Architects</h2><p>The global changes taking place in the architectural world are crystallizing right now in Japan, with the past five years being considered one of the most innovative periods in current Japanese design history.

The Furies (Tisiphone, Alecto, and Megaera) make three brief and vicious appearances; Evslin dwells on the horrific aspects of these goddesses and omits their part in the myths of Orestes, depriving readers of the rich complexity of the Furies' dual nature as the Eumenides, protectors of the suppliant. The Furies of this volume truly fit the bill, yet Evslin trivializes them by writing that their pet names for each other are Tiss, Ally, and Meg. Most mythology collections describe this trio as snake-haired, but there is no mention of it here. Also, the attempt to modernize these myths is less than successful: the text is an uncomfortable mix of formal narrative, inane dialogue, and unnecessary editorializing. The numerous illustrations are handsome reproductions of art works representative of many cultures and times. They are misleading, however: although the captions imply that the pictures illustrate the text, they rarely have anything to do with the story being told. Attempting to popularize the myths is admirable, but not at the expense of the original. --Cynthia Bishop, Onondaga County Public Library, Syracuse, NY</p><p>Copyright 1990 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Introduction to the Devout Life</h2><p>In Introduction to the Devout Life, 17th-century French clergyman Francis de Sales addresses himself to the mass of Christians who do not believe it possible that they could live a devout life while also struggling to make their way in the world.

Accordingly, the book is arranged as a self-help guide to lead the reader through the process of developing a life lived in accordance with God. Christians seeking a deeper connection with the divine will find this an inspiring read. French bishop and Roman Catholic saint FRANCIS DE SALES (1567-1622) is known for his work converting Protestants to Catholicism. He was a renowned preacher and writer; among his works is Treatise on the Love of God.</p><p>Francis de Sales took seriously the words of Christ, Learn of me for I am meek and humble of heart. As he said himself, it took him 20 years to conquer his quick temper, but no one ever suspected he had such a problem, so overflowing with good nature and kindness was his usual manner of acting.

Willa Cather, wanting to be judged on her work alone, clearly forbade the publication of her letters in her will. But now, more than sixty-five years after her death, with her literary reputation as secure as a reputation can be, the letters have become available for publication.<br><br> The 566 letters collected here, nearly 20 percent of the total, range from the funny (and mostly misspelled) reports of life in Red Cloud in the 1880s that Cather wrote as a teenager, through those from her college years at the University of Nebraska, her time as a journalist in Pittsburgh and New York, and during her growing eminence as a novelist. Postcards and letters describe her many travels around the United States and abroad, and they record her last years in the 1940s, when the loss of loved ones and the disasters of World War II brought her near to despair. Written to family and close friends and to such luminaries as Sarah Orne Jewett, Robert Frost, Yehudi Menuhin, Sinclair Lewis, and the president of Czechoslovakia, Thomas Masaryk, they reveal her in her daily life as a woman and writer passionately interested in people, literature, and the arts in general.<br><br> The voice heard in these letters is one we already know from her fiction: confident, elegant, detailed, openhearted, concerned with profound ideas, but also at times funny, sentimental, and sarcastic. Unfiltered as only intimate communication can be, they are also full of small fibs, emotional outbursts, inconsistencies, and the joys and sorrows of the moment. <i>The Selected Letters</i> is a deep pleasure to read and to ponder, sure to appeal to those with a special devotion to Cather as well as to those just making her acquaintance.</p></p><p><p>Andrew Jewell is an associate professor at the University of Nebraska&#x2013;Lincoln and editor of the Willa Cather Archive (cather.unl.edu). He is coeditor of the book <i>The American Literature Scholar in the Digital Age </i>and a member of the Willa Cather Foundation Board of Governors.<br> &nbsp;<br> Janis Stout is the author of nine scholarly books, including <i>Willa Cather: The Writer and Her World</i> and two books about Katherine Anne Porter. She has also edited two volumes on Cather and written a memoir about retirement, <i>This Last House</i>.<br></p>Introduction<br><br> Before Willa Cather died, she did what she could to prevent this book from ever existing. She made a will that clearly forbade all publication of her letters, in full or in part. And now we flagrantly defy Cather&#x2019;s will in the belief that her decision, made in the last, dark years of her life and honored for more than half a century, is outweighed by the value of making these letters avail- able to readers all over the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why did she put such restrictions in her will? Various answers have been proposed. Some believe that Cather was guarding her privacy, perhaps worried that the letters she dashed off over the years, not thinking of herself as a public figure, would compromise her literary reputation. Some have wondered if she sought to conceal a secret buried in her years of correspondence, some sign of an indiscretion or uncontrolled passion. Many people, following James Woodress&#x2019;s characterization of her in <i>Willa Cather: A Literary Life</i>, are convinced that Cather was obsessed with her privacy and that the will&#x2014;together with her supposed systematic collecting and burning of letters&#x2014;was simply an expression of a personality seeking to control all access to itself. Many have believed she actually did burn all her letters, or almost all, and the will was a kind of backstop.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our research on Willa Cather&#x2019;s letters calls into question all of these assumptions about Cather, her character, and her motivations. Except for an isolated incident or two, there is no evidence that she systematically collected and destroyed her correspondence. This claim is overwhelmingly demonstrated by the large volume of surviving documents: about three thousand Cather letters are now known to exist, and new caches continue to appear. If Cather or Edith Lewis, her partner and first literary executor, really and systematically sought to destroy all correspondence, would so many letters have survived? Moreover, at the end of Cather&#x2019;s life, people who were quite close to her and would have undoubtedly known about any preference for wholesale destruction did not destroy the letters in their possession; on the contrary, they were concerned, as her niece Virginia Cather Brockway wrote, to be &#x201c;very careful of everything of Aunt Willies&#x201d; and protect it from &#x201c;fire or something unexpected.&#x201d; (See the full letter from Virginia Cather Brockway to Meta Schaper Cather on page 676.) <br> &nbsp;<br> Indeed, some of the largest and richest collections of existing Cather letters are those that have been protected for decades by members of her family. The episodes of destruction that have given rise to the supposition that Cather destroyed her letters&#x2014;for example, Elizabeth Sergeant&#x2019;s report in her memoir that all of the letters Cather wrote to her dear friend Isabelle McClung Hambourg were shoved into her apartment&#x2019;s incinerator after Ham- bourg&#x2019;s death (Elizabeth Sergeant, <i>Willa Cather: A Memoir</i> (Athens: Ohio University Press, 1992) 275) &#x2014;appear to be isolated incidents rather than part of a larger pattern of obliteration.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nevertheless, Cather&#x2019;s testamentary restriction on the publication of her letters was clearly driven by a desire to restrict the readership of them. We do not believe that desire emerged from a need to shield herself or protect a secret, but instead was an act consistent with her long-held desire to shape her own public identity. In her maturity, Cather was a skillful self-marketer, and a major element of her marketing strategy was to limit her publicly available texts to those she had meticulously prepared. She did not fill shelves with hastily written novels or fleeting topical essays, but toiled over each book until it succeeded to the best of her ability. Sometimes she delayed the publication of a novel by months or even years in order to achieve her artistic goals. She even contributed to the design of the physical books, considering each element that might communicate something of her work to the reader. She specified her margin preferences for My ï¿½ntonia, had ideas about the font type for Death Comes for the Archbishop, and thwarted most efforts to create paperback editions during her lifetime. Her strategy was extremely successful. By positioning herself not as a &#x201c;popular&#x201d; writer but as a literary artist, she was able to give herself the space to be such an artist while also financially succeeding in the marketplace. Her lovely, quiet, episodic novel about seventeenth-century Quebec, Shadows on the Rock, was one of the top-selling books of 1931. It was not a success because readers were rushing to read a novel about colonial Canada, but because the novel was written by the celebrated author Willa Cather.<br> &nbsp;<br> We can guess that Cather may have believed that an edition of her letters would shift focus away from her novels and onto her private self. She was impatient with writers who managed to sell their books by constructing dramatic images of themselves. Although she did at times contribute to publicity efforts by providing stories of her early life, her goal was to create a persona that practically disappeared behind the work; she sought to meld the art and the artist into one indivisible package. She wrote to her brother Roscoe in 1940 that she was satisfied to do what James M. Barrie and Thomas Hardy did: they &#x201c;left no &#x2018;representatives&#x2019; but their own books,&#x2014;and that is best&#x201d; (See page 588). In this way, the resistance to the publication of her letters was consistent with her resistance, in her later years, to lecturing, interviews, and other forms of exposing her self to the public.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cather&#x2019;s suppression of the publication of her letters may indeed have helped cement her reputation as a true artist, and today that reputation is virtually unchallenged. In the nearly seven decades since her death, her works have continued to be read, studied, and celebrated, and both general readers and contemporary writers as diverse as A. S. Byatt and David Mamet celebrate her fine artistry and her absolute dedication to her craft. And rightly so: many of Cather&#x2019;s novels and stories are among the finest writings of the twentieth century, rich and complex in their meaning-making, yet elegant and pristine on their surfaces. She manages both to enchant readers with her prose and to move them with her insights into human experience.<br> &nbsp;<br> We fully realize that in producing this book of selected letters we are defying Willa Cather&#x2019;s stated preference that her letters remain hidden from the public eye. But even her will itself envisions a moment when her preferences would not rule the day; acknowledging her inability to govern publication decisions indefinitely from beyond the grave, it leaves the decision for publication &#x201c;to the sole and uncontrolled discretion of my Executors and Trustee&#x201d; (Willa Cather, will dated April 29, 1943, Paragraph Seventh). Observing this part of Cather&#x2019;s will, Norman Holmes Pearson noted more than half a century ago that the document recognizes &#x201c;certain difficulties in regard to the future.&#x201d; &#x201c;The future must make its own decisions,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;All Miss Cather could do was to make the future as remote as possible&#x201d; (Norman Holmes Pearson, &#x201c;The Problem of Literary Executorship,&#x201d; <i>Studies in Bibliography 5 </i>(1952&#x2013;53), 8).<br> &nbsp;<br> The concerns that we believe motivated her to assert her preference are no longer valid. Cather&#x2019;s reputation is now as secure as artistic reputations can ever be, and her works will continue to speak for themselves. These lively, illuminating letters will do nothing to damage her reputation. Instead, we can see from our twenty-first-century perspective that her letters heighten our sense of her complex personality, provide insights into her methods and artistic choices as she worked, and reveal Cather herself to be a complicated, funny, brilliant, flinty, sensitive, sometimes confounding human being. Such an identity is far more satisfying&#x2014;and more honest&#x2014;than that of a &#x201c;pure&#x201d; artist, unmoved by commercial motivations, who devoted herself strictly to her creations and nothing else.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the past&#x2014;unless they were lucky enough to have sufficient resources of time and money to travel to the almost seventy-five archives that house the letters themselves&#x2014;readers and scholars interested in Cather&#x2019;s life and works were able to read only summaries and paraphrasings of her letters, not her actual words. Having ourselves summarized thousands of letters for the original or the expanded Calendar of the Letters of Willa Cather, we can attest to the inadequacy of such paraphrases. Substituting our words (or anyone else&#x2019;s) for Cather&#x2019;s own expressions of her meaning is never satisfactory. Second- hand approximations can never precisely convey what she said herself. Could a summary ever communicate the cheeky, alliterative fun of a postscript like &#x201c;Fremstad flees on Friday to the inclement wood of Maine,&#x201d; at the end of a 1914 letter to Elizabeth Sergeant (See page 190)? <br> &nbsp;<br> Cather&#x2019;s restrictions in her will, then, by making paraphrases the only option available to scholars and biographers, created a situation that even Cather herself would surely consider far worse than the publication of her letters. Readers have been forced to encounter what she &#x201c;said&#x201d; in her letters through words supplied by scholars seeking to convey what they understood her to mean. Now we will all be able to read and interpret her letters for ourselves. We will also be able to draw more accurate connections between the letters and the fiction. By forcing a delay of many years in publishing a volume of her letters, Cather&#x2019;s restrictions did, however, ensure that there is no longer any possibility of harming or embarrassing the people who appear in her correspondence.<br> Cather is now a part of our cultural history. Her works belong to some- thing greater than herself. It is time to let the letters speak for themselves.<br> &nbsp;<br> Because of the prevalence of Nebraska settings in her fiction, most readers know Willa Cather as a Nebraskan. In fact, she was born in Virginia and spent her childhood on a sheep farm near the town of Winchester. She told University of Virginia professor Stringfellow Barr in 1928, &#x201c;I always feel very deeply that I am a Virginian&#x201d; (See page 413). She was nine years old in April of 1883 when her family moved to Webster County, Nebraska, where they joined other family members who had gone before. It was an enormous change to go from the green hills of northern Virginia, where the family had been established for generations, to the nearly treeless prairie of central Nebraska. In a 1913 inter- view in the Philadelphia Record, Cather recalled the jolt of her arrival:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I shall never forget my introduction to it. We drove out from Red Cloud to my grandfather&#x2019;s homestead one day in April. I was sitting on the hay in the bottom of a Studebaker wagon, holding on to the side of the wagon box to steady myself&#x2014;the roads were mostly faint trails over the bunch grass in those days. The land was open range and there was almost no fencing. As we drove further and further out into the country, I felt a good deal as if we had come to the end of everything&#x2014;it was a kind of erasure of personality.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I would not know how much a child&#x2019;s life is bound up in the woods and hills and meadows around it, if I had not been jerked away from all these and thrown out into a country as bare as a piece of sheet iron. I had heard my father say you had to show grit in a new country, and I would have got on pretty well during that ride if it had not been for the larks. Every now and then one flew up and sang a few splendid notes and dropped down into the grass again. That reminded me of something&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know what, but my one purpose in life just then was not to cry, and every time they did it, I thought I should go under.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;For the first week or two on the homestead I had that kind of contraction of the stomach which comes from homesickness. I didn&#x2019;t like canned things anyhow, and I made an agreement with myself that I would not eat much until I got back to Virginia and could get some fresh mutton. I think the first thing that interested me after I got to the homestead was a heavy hickory cane with a steel tip which my grandmother always carried with her when she went to the garden to kill rattlesnakes. She had killed a good many snakes with it, and that seemed to argue that life might not be so flat as it looked there (&#x201c;Willa Cather Talks of Work,&#x201d; in <i>Willa Cather in Person</i>, ed. L. Brent Bohlke (Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1986), 10). <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Some of the first people she became acquainted with had immigrated to the Great Plains from Sweden, Norway, and Bohemia. These people were extremely interesting to her. She said in the same interview, &#x201c;I have never found any intellectual excitement any more intense than I used to feel when I spent a morning with one of those old women at her baking or butter making. I used to ride home in the most unreasonable state of excitement; I always felt as if they told me so much more than they said&#x2014;as if I had actually got inside another person&#x2019;s skin.&#x201d;<br> These immigrant women&#x2014;and others she knew in Webster County and the town of Red Cloud, Nebraska&#x2014;would remain in Cather&#x2019;s memory and imagination until the end of her life. They populate much of her fiction. Indeed, the town of Red Cloud, where Cather lived from about age eleven until not quite seventeen, when she went away to school in Lincoln, served as a model for many small towns in her fiction: Black Hawk, Moonstone, Sweet Water, Hanover, Skyline, Haverford. Her life there as a child, reinforced by many long visits home over the years, made Red Cloud central to Willa Cather&#x2019;s life and self-conception.<br> &nbsp;<br> When she went to Lincoln, to the University of Nebraska, in 1890, she planned to study science (she had befriended some of the doctors in Red Cloud and on one occasion reportedly helped administer chloroform during an amputation); however, she soon turned to writing and literature, editing the campus literary magazine and writing for the Nebraska State Journal. Her columns and reviews for that newspaper, which she began with gusto at age nineteen, started her on her first career as a journalist. After graduating from college, she got a job as the managing editor of a national magazine, the Home Monthly, and in 1896 moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After the magazine collapsed, she worked for Pittsburgh newspapers and then as a high school teacher, spending nearly a decade in Pittsburgh in all. In 1906 she moved to New York City to join the editorial staff of McClure&#x2019;s Magazine. She soon became managing editor of this highly popular and important periodical and, until she left the position in 1912, was arguably one of the most powerful women in journalism.<br> &nbsp;<br> She left McClure&#x2019;s because what she really wanted to do was to be a professional writer. During her years in Lincoln, Pittsburgh, and New York (which remained her permanent address until her death in 1947), she wrote and published many short stories in magazines, published a book of poems (April Twilights), and released a book of short fiction (The Troll Garden). Her first novel, Alexander&#x2019;s Bridge, appeared in 1912, the same year as her long short story &#x201c;T...</p><h2>The Monk&#39;s Record Player: Thomas Merton, Bob Dylan, and the Perilous Summer of 1966</h2><p><p><i>The story of a monk, a minstrel, and the music that brought them together</i><br><br> In 1965 writer-activist-monk Thomas Merton fulfilled a twenty-four-year dream and went to live as a hermit beyond the walls of his Trappist monastery.

Yet on the very day that his abbot uncovered the affair, Merton found solace in an unlikely place&#x2014;the songs of Bob Dylan, who, as fate would have it, was experiencing his own personal and creative crises during the summer of 1966.&nbsp;</p><p>In this striking parallel biography of two countercultural icons, Robert Hudson plumbs the depths of Dylan&#x2019;s surprising influence on Merton&#x2019;s life and writing, recounts each man&#x2019;s interactions with the woman who linked them together&#x2014;Joan Baez&#x2014;and shows how each transcended his immediate troubles and went on to new heights of spiritual and artistic genius.

He looks at how people have coped with these anxieties in the past with a range of unexpected examples and entertaining anecdotes.</p><p>&#x201c;Every adult life could be said to be defined by two great love stories. The first&#x2014;the story of our quest for sexual love&#x2014;is well known and well charted. . . . The second&#x2014;the story of our quest for love from the world&#x2014;is a more secret and shameful tale. And yet this second love story is no less intense than the first.&#x201d;<br><br>This is a book about an almost universal anxiety that rarely gets mentioned directly: an anxiety about what others think of us, about whether we&#x2019;re judged a success or a failure, a winner or a loser. This is a book about status anxiety.<br><br>Alain de Botton, best-selling author of <i>The Consolations of Philosophy </i>and <i>The Art of Travel</i>, asks&#x2014;with lucidity and charm&#x2014;where our worries about status come from and what, if anything, we can do to surmount them. With the help of philosophers, artists and writers, he examines the origins of status anxiety (ranging from the consequences of the French Revolution to our secret dismay at the success of our friends) before revealing ingenious ways in which people have been able to overcome their worries in the search for happiness. We learn about sandal-less philosophers and topless bohemians, about the benefits of putting skulls on our sideboards, and about looking at ancient ruins.<br> <br>The result is a book that isn&#x2019;t just highly entertaining and thought-provoking, but that is genuinely wise and helpful, too.Alain de Botton is the author of Essays in Love, The Romantic Movement, Kiss and Tell, How Proust Can Change Your Life, The Consolations of Philosophy, The Art of Travel, Status Anxiety, The Architecture of Happiness, The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work, A Week at the Airport, Religion for Atheists, The News: A User&#39;s Manual, and latest novel The Course of Love, among many others.

Brother Jesus leads us through the twists and turns of history to reveal the figure who extends a &#34;brotherly hand&#34; to the author as a fellow Jew.Ben-Chorin&#39;s reach is astounding as he moves easily between literature, law, etymology, psychology, and theology to recover &#34;Jesus&#39; picture from the Christian overpainting.&#34; A commanding scholar of the historical Jesus who also devoted his life to widening Jewish-Christian dialogue, Ben-Chorin ranges across such events as the wedding at Cana, the Last Supper, and the crucifixion to reveal, in contemporary Christianity, traces of the Jewish codes and customs in which Jesus was immersed. Not only do we see how and why these events also resonate with Jews, but we are brought closer to Christianity in its primitive state: radical, directionless, even pagan.Early in his book, Ben-Chorin writes, &#34;the belief of Jesus unifies us, but</p><p>Schalom Ben-Chorin (1913-1999) wrote some thirty books on Jewish historical and cultural themes, of which <i>Brother Jesus</i> was his acknowledged favorite. German-born and -educated, Ben-Chorin emigrated to Jerusalem in 1935, where he spent the remainder of his life. In the aftermath of World War II, he worked tirelessly to repair relations between Jews and Germans and between Christians and Jews. His many awards include the Buber-Rosenzweig Medal and the Leo Baeck Prize. Jared S. Klein is a professor of linguistics, classics, and Germanic and Slavic languages at the University of Georgia. Max Reinhart is a professor of German and head of the Department of Germanic and Slavic Languages at the University of Georgia."This is a precious book. We see a Jewish intellectual deconstructing the Christian gospels in his quest to reconstruct his brother Jesus. It is also a poignant book. For though he knew that the gospels were Christian myth, they were the only texts he had. His pursuit of historical truth despite the mystifications of the texts reveals the no-nonsense logic of an exceptionally well-trained mind in a relentless struggle with German scholarship. And in the end, by an amazing control of historical imagination, Ben-Chorin does catch sight of his non-Christian Jewish brother. Some will celebrate this book as the excellent translation of a most readable classic on the historical Jesus. But it is more. It is a moving documentation of a little-known chapter of cultural and intellectual history. It should be read as a meditation on the civility and skill of a German-Jewish scholar in pre- and post-holocaust debate with the Christian mind."&#x2014;Burton L. Mack<br><br>"For centuries we Christians have imagined a composite gospel picture of Jesus's life and viewed it through the developing tradition of our own faith. It has usually been the Nazarene through Christian eyes. But what happens when a Jew imagines the Nazarene through Jewish eyes? Schalom Ben-Chorin's 1967 classic gives Jesus his proper context as a first-century Jew and sees him within that Judaism's vibrant and on-going tradition. But his book also carries a deeper challenge in the delicacy of its titular address and the pain of its terminal image. Those who stand with the crucifiers cannot stand with the crucified. Where have we Christians been standing throughout most of those centuries? Who, then, is brother to 'the Jew on the cross'?"&#x2014;John Dominic Crossan<br><br>"[An] elegant translation of the 1967 German original."--<i>Journal of the American Academy of Religion</i></p><h2>The Case of the Swirling Killer Tornado (Hank the Cowdog #25)</h2><p>This just in from the Emergency Weather Service: A tornado is headed straight for the ranch!

Mistaking it for an alien invasion, they finagle their way into the ranch owners' house. When a tornado is predicted, the family takes shelter in the cellar. The two canines find themselves lifted into the center of the tornado, along with cows, buzzards, etc., and gently deposited into the branches of a tree. This thinly plotted story starts out incoherently and, although it gets better, it is a case of too little too late. The author attempts to use language creatively, but ultimately fails. The descriptions of the confusion caused by the thunder and lightning are ineffective, partly because Hank and Drover speak and act more like war veterans going through a flashback than domestic animals in the throes of a storm. Their conversations, and also those among the other animals in the tornado's funnel cloud, are silly and unbelievable, as are the characterizations.?Carrie A.

It was not at crouched on the stand, pondering. It was not given to the stresses of emotion, but did feel troubled. The situation of their trio was not good, and the Feline nulls were suffering. Something needed to be done, but the course of action that offered was not benign. Perhaps they would be best off if they simply waited out the negative period, trusting to time to ameliorate the problem.Cat felt as if its tail were twitching nervously, though of course there was no tail. The course of action that offered had a limited period for adoption, and that period ended in one more day. Thereafter that option would be lost, and it seemed unlikely that it would be repeated. Cat suspected that it related to the Virtual Mode project; if so, it was of special interest to the Felines. Perhaps it should be mentioned to the others. Yet their emotions governed them unduly; it was their nature. They were too apt to react rashly.There was one day remaining to decide. Cat put its headdown and napped, awaiting the return of the others.There was no mistaking their arrival. Tom's extended toe-claws clacked against the floor, evidence of anger. Pussy was mewling, evidence of grief. Something ill had happened.They burst into the chamber. Tom was a powerful figure of a human man, his only feline aspects being his head, retractable claws, and a certain furriness. Pussy was a lovely figure of a human female, with the facial features of her feline persuasion. They were really human androids with their features tweaked to make them suggest cats, exactly as was the case with Cat itself. Male, female, and neuter: the Feline nulls."Oh, Cat!" Pussy cried, stepping into Cat's reassuring embrace. "It was awful!" Now, in privacy, she felt free to let her tears flow."It was an outrage!" Tom snapped, striking the featureless dummy and raking it with his claws."Let me guess," Cat said, letting Pussy sob into its shoulder. "The Swine?""The Swine," Tom agreed. "We were just trying to dance at the null club. No one asked us, so Pussy addressed a Canine. Hound looked interested. They were about to dance, when Sow cut in and took Hound herself. The others laughed. They won't let us forget, even for a moment." He clawed the dummy again."Hound would have danced with me," Pussy said brokenly. "He liked me. I could tell. He would have taken me into the private stall and humped me. I haven't been humped in a month! And Sow knew it.""And I can't hump any of the females," Tom growled. "They all look down on me, because I'm unemployed.""Because <i>we're</i> unemployed," Cat said. "Remember, we are in this together.""I wish we could get an assignment," Pussy sobbed, not much comforted. "Why can't we?""You <i>know</i> why," Tom said, clawing the dummy again. "The employers don't want us.""But it wasn't our fault!""But they still blame us," Tom said. This time he actually gouged out a chunk of material."It's so unfair! We're good nulls. We never fouled up."Cat was on the verge of deciding. He postponed it for a moment by clarifying their situation once agian. "We are good nulls, and it is unfair to make us pariahs. But this is the way the limited minds of the Swine work, and the others take their cues from them.""Because the Swine serve Ddwng," Tom said. This time he punched the dummy, and it rocked back with the force of the blow. Because his hands were essentially human, he could do this when he chose."So <i>they</i> fouled up," Pussy said, finally disengaging from Cat. "So why aren't they blamed?"Cat tried to find a way to explain it that she could accept. She was emotional, and that got in the way of her thinking. "It is the convention that the master can't make a mistake. So when something goes wrong, someone else must be blamed. I doubt that anyone could have protected Ddwng from that error, but it is the job of the Swine to facilitate his convenience in any way feasible, so the implication is that they failed. They can't accept that, so they suggest that we, as the nulls serving the alien visitor, must have been at fault. Therefore the blame falls on us, and we have no one to pass it along to. We have become the pariahs of convenience. Therefore unemployable, until the situation changes.""Just what did go wrong?" Tom asked. "All I heard was that Ddwng was ready to go with the alien party, there in the palace. Then he changed his mind, and they were gone without him.""There was a factor none of us in the DoOon Mode understood," Cat said. "Do you remember the horse?""Horse?" Pussy asked blankly."The young woman Colene came with a beast of burden, a horse," Cat explained. "A stallion who was immediately stabled. It seems that the animal was telepathic.""Telepathic! You mean it could read minds?""Yes. That horse was in mental contact with the girl. It was able to receive and project thoughts. When Ddwng was ready to travel on the Virtual Mode, the horse sent him a thought: a command to free the anchor. Ddwng did that without realizing it until after the fact. I believe it was a very sudden, very powerful thought, striking at a time when the master was making an effort to be mentally receptive to the nature of the Virtual Mode. So he was ambushed, and the alien party escaped.""But a horse--a literal horse, not an Equine null? They don't have human intelligence. How could a mere horse do such a thing?""Whether the animal was sapient at the human level I don't know," Cat said. "I suspect there are stranger things on the Virtual Mode than we know. But it may not have needed such intelligence. It merely obeyed the will of the girl. <i>She</i> was the key to the loss of the Virtual Mode. It seems that Ddwng seriously misjudged the situation, not realizing the power the girl had through the horse.""So she tricked Ddwng, and he is angry, and the blame descends on us because we served her man, Darius," Pussy said, finally getting it."Yes. Perhaps we should have fathomed that aspect, and warned Ddwng. We did not, and could not, because it seems that Darius himself did not know of the horse's nature. The Swine should have fathomed it.""It isn't fair," she repeated, her delicate whiskers trembling."If only we could fight back!" Tom said.Cat decided. "Perhaps we can."Both oriented on the neuter, knowing that it never made foolish or emotional statements. "How?" Tom demanded."It is dangerous.""Anything," Pussy said.So Cat told them. "As you know, I am undistracted by most passions of the flesh, so I have attention for intellectual pursuits. I track the releases of special projects. One is now available that I strongly suspect relates to the Virtual Mode.""Where Darius came from," Pussy said. "Is he coming back?" She had on one occasion come close to seducing the man, and surely had a hankering to complete that business."Perhaps. I understand there are different Virtual Modes, with different travelers. But it seems likely, because Darius had the use of a Chip. I believe the Swine have been watching, and are aware when an anchor changes. I think they want to be ready the next time there is opportunity for our Mode to become an anchor. Since there needs to be an anchor person or persons, they may have in mind training suitable prospects. Of course this is mere conjecture on my part; I am surely mistaken on details, or perhaps on the whole.""But you know something," Tom said."What I know is that there is an opening for volunteers to undertake dangerous training for an important mission. It may not be this one. But if it is, we may have an inherent advantage, because we have had contact with a man who has traveled a Virtual Mode.""Darius," Pussy said dreamily. "I just know I can do him the favor of seducing him.""I think not," Cat said firmly. "The aliens seemed to have different ideas about sexual relations. The man may have been amenable, but the young woman did not wish him to indulge with anyone except her.""But she didn't indulge with him," Pussy protested. "I just know it.""Different cultures, different foibles. It is possible that one reason the woman wished to escape our Mode was that she did not like your association with Darius."She pondered that. "So I may not seduce him?""Not until we know his situation better. But this is academic; we don't know that we will see him again.""Unless we take that opening," Tom said gruffly."Agreed. And it may be for something else entirely. The chance of mortality is listed at fifty percent. So this is not something to undertake lightly.""But it would redeem us?" Pussy asked hopefully."I believe so, if we survive it.""So we'll take it," Tom said.Cat looked at Pussy. She nodded. "We'll take it."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Emperor Ddwng himself made the presentation. He was a man in his fifties, portly and with receding reddish hair, but with piercing black eyes. There was an intensity about him that would have alerted others even if he were not supreme. "Eight teams of nulls are competing. Your mission is to obtain this flag and bring it back here." He held up a silver banner. "When this one is taken, it will be replaced by a lesser flag; the team that brings that one back will be the reserve. There are no other rules." He paused, and they realized that this meant that they could cheat and kill if they had reason. "But there is a complication. You will be accompanied by two human nulls in the forms of our recent visitors from the Virtual Mode: a mature man named Dar and a young woman named Col. The man is trustworthy and knows the location of the flag. The woman can not be trusted, but she knows the route,and will do what the man wishes. She may have special powers. The man will not reveal the location of the flag unless persuaded, and the one who can most readily persuade him is the woman. Thus you will have to relate to these two people, as well as to the hazards of the course itself. The people will not cooperate unless induced. You will be issued pain controls that will work on nulls, but caution is advised because once you hurt them, they will feel free to hurt you. We judge the likely mortality rate to be fifty percent, but this is approximate; it is possible that all of you will die."He gave them a moment to assimilate this, then spoke again. "The winning team will go into training for travel on a Virtual Mode. This is a mission of honor, and the team members will assume the temporary status of full human officers of my court, with the right to address me personally. If the mission on the Virtual Mode is successful, that status will become permanent."All around them, the assembled nulls reacted. Human officer status! This was an unprecedented reward. Cat was not given to emotion, but even it felt the magnitude of this potential. Tom was staring, and Pussy seemed about to faint. The other nulls were responding similarly. All of them were awed. This was a prospect well worth the risk of death. Seldom did any null trio achieve such recognition."Your prisoners are in the eight scattered cubicles," Ddwng continued after a moment. "Proceed." He turned away, dismissing them from his attention.There was a scramble to reach the cubes. "Let's wait a moment," Cat murmured. "We may profit from observing."Tom had been about to launch toward the nearest cube, and Pussy was not far behind. But at Cat's words, they both drew back. They trusted its judgment.There were eight trios and eight cubes, but in their eagernessto be first, three teams converged on the closest cube--the one that the felines would have gone to. These were Ovine, Bovine, and Equine. The Equine horse saw the problem and called off the stallion and mare; they galloped for a farther cube. But the Ovine ram and Bovine bull came together before the cube, lowering their heads. They were of similar size--human--and similar temperament--male--and similar armament--horns. But the use of the horns differed. The ram tried to butt, while the bull tried to gore. The contest was brief and inconclusive, as their neuters called them off and guided them to different cubes. The closest cube was left free."Wait longer," Cat said. "Watch."So they did not approach the cube. Instead they watched the other nulls as they went to the cubes and opened the doors. This much was routine; the man and woman emerged when released, seeming amenable. The male was slightly taller than the male nulls, and the female was somewhat shorter than the female nulls; she was in fact small for a grown woman. Neither was particularly imposing; the man was not muscular and the girl was not buxom.The Swine were the first to get on their way. They ran, and the prisoners ran ahead of them. "They are using the pain buttons," Cat said. It brought out the one they had been given. "The pain is generalized, but strongest nearest the button. So the prisoners are being caused to run by a lash at their backsides, as it were. That is evidently effective, but for how long?""Those buttons hurt," Pussy said. "They can hurt a lot."She was thinking of the time the Felines had been assigned to be with a visiting woman of somewhat sadistic nature. Pussy had done her best to oblige, but the woman seemed to resent her sexy nature, and had burned her on any pretext. Cat had been unable to prevent this mistreatment. They had of course not spoken of it to any otherhuman, but the other nulls had known, and soon the button was replaced with one whose pain was nominal. Pussy had known immediately to act as if the pain were its usual intensity, and so they had gotten by. The masters and mistresses were not normally cruel to nulls, but visitors could be."How do you think a willful human would react to being prodded in this manner?" Cat asked Pussy."He would be angry," she said immediately. "He would strike back, when he had the chance."Cat nodded. "The customary arrogance of the Swine may be their own undoing."Meanwhile the other teams were proceeding at a slower pace. The general pattern seemed to be a somewhat threatening posture by the male, so that the prisoners realized that it was safest for them to cooperate. They were moving out, but did not seem entirely happy about it."They're getting ahead of us," Tom said restlessly."Perhaps. Would there be an advantage to persuasion?" Cat inquired rhetorically.Tom let his claws spring out from his right hand. "I can persuade as well as any.""That is not persuasion," Cat said. "That is threat. How would you do it, Pussy?""I would seduce the male," she said."You tried that before," Tom reminded her. "And made an enemy of the girl.""Meow," she said, embarrassed. "Maybe I should befriend the girl instead.""I suspect that would be wise," Cat said. "Other teams are using force of one kind or another. That may indeed be the answer. But we were warned that there will be surprises. Some of them may be in the nature of the prisoners. I think we should set ourselves apart from the others by truly befriending the prisoners, if that is feasible. That may not be the winning strategy, but it would bedifferent, and sometimes difference is the key to succ...</p><h2>They Don&#39;t Dance Much: A Novel</h2><p><b>In this classic country noir, featuring a new introduction by Daniel Woodrell, a small town farmer takes a job at a roadhouse, where unbridled greed leads to a brutal murder </b><br>Jack McDonald is barely a farmer.

The garden becomes an island of civilization in a brutal world.</p><p>Giorgio Bassani's masterwork has Vittorio de Sica's 1971 film adaptation to thank for its dual success and obscurity. Not enough people know that this tale of a middle-class Jewish youth's obsession with the far more aristocratic Micol Finzi-Contini stems from a novel, not a novelization. Bassani's doom- and tomb-ridden examination of one-sided love is far more complex--about individuals' inability to contend with personal and political annihilation. Events call for heroism, yet it seems "downright absurd that now, all of a sudden, exceptional behavior was demanded of us." The narrator writes in retrospect, 13 years after World War II's end, and reveals the Finzi-Continis' 1943 deportation to Germany right from the start: "Who could say if they found any sort of burial at all?" <p> As Fascist racial laws go from strength to strength, the family, which had long isolated itself from the other inhabitants of Ferrara, opens its walled grounds and tennis court to other young Jews and even returns to the local temple. Unfortunately, the situation encourages the narrator's dream that Micol will return his love, and she is forced into cruel honesty. "She looked into my eyes, and her gaze entered me, straight, sure, hard: with the limpid inexorability of a sword." </p><p> The author has re-created a tragic era in which even nobility could not outrun events, let alone admit they needed to. (For a nonfiction account of the fates of five Italian Jewish families under fascism, see Alexander Stille's <i>Benevolence and Betrayal</i>.) Bassani's elision of historical and personal agony is furthermore superbly translated by William Weaver. All is foretold in the novel's Manzonian epigraph, "The heart, to be sure, always has something to say about what is to come, to him who heeds it. But what does the heart know? Only a little of what has already happened."</p><p>Giorgio Bassani was born in 1916. From 1938 onwards he became involved in various anti-fascist activities for which he was imprisoned in 1943. His works include <i>The Gold-Rimmed Spectacles</i>, and <i>Five Stories of Ferrara (Within the Walls)</i>, which won the Strega Prize. <i>The Garden of the Finzi-Continis</i> was awarded the Viareggio Prize in 1962 and was made into a feature film. <br><br>William Weaver was an award-winning poet and translator.

Christoph Irmscher explores how, through the acts of organizing physical artifacts and reflecting upon their collections through writings and images, naturalists from John Bartram to Louis Agassiz were making sense of themselves and their world. These collections allowed them, in a way, to collect themselves. <br><br>In the first part of his book, Irmscher offers us a guided tour of the actual collections, beginning in Bartram&#x2019;s disorderly botanical garden in Philadelphia and taking us through the artful display of animals in Charles Wilson Peale&#x2019;s collections and, finally, to the &#x201c;halls of humbug&#x201d; of P. T. Barnum&#x2019;s American Museum. The second part of the book moves away from the collections, and explores natural history words and images. Irmscher unforgettably describes American collectors&#x2019; fascination and horror with the American rattlesnake, and invokes the violent and beautiful world of American birds as described in John James Audubon&#x2019;s paintings and writings.&nbsp; His book ends with a description of Louis Agassiz&#x2019;s 1865 expedition to Brazil as seen through the eyes of the young William James, who reluctantly gathered Brazilian fish while his mentor assembled &#x201c;proof&#x201d; that some human beings were less human than others.</p></p><p>American natural history owes much to gifted amateurs who, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, traveled widely, collected willy-nilly, and then, back at home, devoted years to sorting through their collections and cataloging their contents--an enterprise that introduced scientific rigor into what had been a kind of hobby. So writes literary scholar Christoph Irmscher, who, in exploring the aesthetic aspects of American natural history, considers the careers of several early naturalists, including Charles Willson Peale, John Bartram, John James Audubon, Louis Agassiz, and, in an unlikely turn, the showman P.T. Barnum, who turned a penchant for collecting oddments of nature into an itinerant freak show. All of these, Irmscher writes, delighted in "transforming relatively random assemblages of natural collectibles into works of art," works that would in many instances form the foundations for what are today important collections. Among the many pleasant surprises in Irmscher's narrative is an account of an 1865 trip organized by Agassiz to the Amazon River. One of the participants was the young William James, who would later become a famed psychologist and who wrote admiringly of Agassiz's relentless energy in pursuit of scientific specimens while admitting, "If there is anything I hate it is collecting." Irmscher's elegant book will be of interest to historians of 19th-century science, and to general readers with a fondness for the work of the brilliant, often eccentric, amateurs of the past. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Major awards for: The Poetics of Natural History by Christoph Irmscher Winner of the Literature and Language Award, Association of American Publishers, Inc. 1999, within the professional/scholarly division!

Are you sure it's Karl, not Groucho? How can you summarize the work of Karl Marx in cartoons? It took Rius to do it.

UP.</p><p>Chaplin, a songwriter, pianist, vocal arranger, music director and producer, has worked on such movie musicals as The Jolson Story, An American in Paris, West Side Story and The Sound of Music. In this chatty memoir he recounts how he started out in Hollywood in 1940 with a songwriting partner, Sammy Cahn, went on to Columbia Pictures and MGM, and ultimately became involved, in various capacities, with dozens of movies. Outspoken about the people he has known during his career, he has harsh words for Harry Cohn, the imperious head of Columbia, and Al Jolson, whom he found abusive to everyone. Chaplin offers fond reminiscences of Frank Sinatra, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Leonard Bernstein, Julie Andrews, Oscar Levant and Cole Porter. His prose is unsophisticated, but his anecdote-filled story is engaging.

D. Ouspensky: The Genius in the Shadow of Gurdjieff</h2><p>P. D. Ouspensky's classic work <i>In Search of the Miraculous</i> was the first to disseminate the ideas of G. I. Gurdjieff, the mysterious master of esoteric thought in the early twentieth century who still commands a following today. Gurdjieff's mystique has long eclipsed Ouspensky, once described by Gurdjieff as "nice to drink vodka with, but a weak man." Yet Ouspensky was a brilliant, accomplished philosopher in his own right, and some consider his meeting with the charismatic "Mr. G." the catastrophe of his life. Indeed, in subsequent years Ouspensky tried hard, with limited success, to break away. This book moves Ouspensky's own story center stage, against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution, the dervishes of Constantinople, and a cosmopolitan Europe entre deux guerres. The archetypal encounter it describes echoes that of Don Juan and Castaneda, or perhaps Mephistopheles and Faust. One of the great mystical adventures of our time, it will fascinate everyone interested in the farthest reaches of what it means to be human.</p><p><b>Gary Lachman</b> is the author of more than a dozen books on the meeting ground between consciousness, culture, and the western esoteric tradition.

During the Second World War he served in the Merchant Marines.<br><br>His first two novels,&nbsp;<b>Dangling Man</b>&nbsp;(1944) and&nbsp;<b>The Victim</b>&nbsp;(1947) are penetrating, Kafka-like psychological studies.

Paranormal superstars Art Bell and Whitley Strieber bring environmentalism to the masses tabloid-style in <i>The Coming Global Superstorm</i>, a quick look at global warming and its potentially catastrophic effects. Like Old Testament prophets, Bell and Strieber embrace lovingly detailed depictions of global cataclysm; unlike them, our modern-day doomsayers have more to go on than that old-time religion. Their writing is clear and straightforward, interspersing hard data with dramatization and speculation to create an engaging, enjoyable, but thoroughly spooky warning of the next Ice Age.<p> Scoffers would do well to remember the 1900 hurricane that devastated Galveston, Texas, despite the clear warnings--we may have advanced our meteorological knowledge over the 20th century, but is our judgment any better? Bell and Strieber are ultimately optimistic that quick behavior change can avert the big storm for a while, even if archaeological evidence suggests its inevitability. Their solutions range from the small scale (buy fuel-efficient cars) to the grandiose (global cooperation in weather monitoring). Whether their suggestions will help is a moot question (how could we ever know?); surely, though, they won't hurt. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><i>Art Bell</i> is one of America's leading talk-radio personalities.

Phrases like &#x201c;phone home&#x201d; and the music score from <i>Jaws</i> are now part of our cultural script, appearing in commercials, comedy routines, and common conversation.</p><p> Yet few scholars have devoted time to studying Spielberg's vast output of popular films despite the director's financial and aesthetic achievements. Spanning twenty-five years of Spielberg's career, <i>Steven Spielberg: Interviews</i>explores the issues, the themes, and the financial considerations surrounding his work. The blockbuster creator of <i>E.T.</i>, <i>Jaws</i>, and <i>Schindler's List</i> talks about dreams and the almighty dollar.</p><p> &#x201c;I'm not really interested in making money,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;That always comes as the result of success, but it's not been my goal, and I've had a tough time proving that to people.&#x201d;</p><p> Ranging from Spielberg's twenties to his mid-fifties, the interviews chart his evolution from a brash young filmmaker trying to make his way in Hollywood, to his spectacular blockbuster triumphs, to his maturation as a director seeking to inspire the imagination with meaningful subjects.</p><p> The Steven Spielberg who emerges in these talks is a complex mix of businessman and artist, of arrogance and insecurity, of shallowness and substance. Often interviewers will uncover the director's human side, noting how changes in Spielberg's personal life&#x2015;marriage, divorce, fatherhood, remarriage&#x2015;affect his movies. But always the interviewers find keys to the storytelling and filmmaking talent that have made Spielberg's characters and themes shape our times and inhabit our dreams.</p><p> &#x201c;Every time I go to a movie, it's magic, no matter what the movie's about,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Whether you watch eight hours of <i>Shoah</i> or whether it's <i>Ghostbusters</i>, when the lights go down in the theater and the movie fades in, it's magic.&#x201d;</p></p><p>A collection of interviews charting Spielberg?s evolution from brash young filmmaker to blockbuster king to mature and meaningful film director<b>Lester D.

(The Waggoner contains 150 maps and 375 photos.)<br>The Waggoner s maps, showing the coverage of each chapter, the harbors, and individual marinas, are one of its most popular features.

Maps of individual marinas detail the entrances and markers, shoal areas, dock layout, and location of the guest moorage and key facilities.<br>The Waggoner is an easy reference to use. To find the page you need, turn to the index, table of contents, or the locator maps in the front of the book. Charts for each area are listed right up front in the chapters. The Waggoner s detailed listings of marine facilities are logically organized and updated each year by Editor Mark Bunzel, correspondents, and the Waggoner staff.<br>More than a catalog of listings and maps, the Waggoner is praised as a good read. The Waggoner is full of navigation tips, weather lore, anchoring ideas, and local knowledge. Serious sidebar features and descriptions explain tide-rips, reversing tidal rapids, stern-tie lines, shellfish toxins, and more. Lighter pieces and descriptions include the lost-in-the- 50s flavor of downtown Olympia; the proper attitude while waiting at the Ballard Locks ( it takes as long as it takes, and that s how it is ); and the discovery of a genuine, fur-bearing trout (very rare) in Prince Rupert.

Huxley's engrossing portrait of a Kenyan tribe and their way of life, with its rituals, its beliefs, its codes and its morality, shows Europeans and their customs in stark, unflattering contrast with the Kikuyu. The differences in their attitudes to war, methods of cultivation, the administering of justice, and the use of money are played out in this novel of the damaging forces of colonization.<br><br>With an Introduction by Richard Dawkins</p><p>Elspeth Huxley (1907-1997) was educated at the European school in Nairobi and at Reading University.

So I offer up sincere thanks to my agent, Steven Chudney, for patiently listening to my flood of ideas. To my editor, Tim Travaglini, for taking a jumbled mass of words and finding the story in it (I knew it was around here somewhere). To the incredible sales and marketing teams at Penguin Young Readers Group. To my colleagues Brian Murray, Josh Marwell, Michael Brennan, Carla Parker, Elise Howard and Liate Stehlik for their unflagging support. To Stephen Dafoe and Christine Leddon for their evangelical efforts on my behalf. To Shelly and Terry Palczewski for always showing up, even though they&#x2019;ve heard it all before. Thanks to the staff at the Homer Public Library for a great event every year. To my mom and sisters for more support than I deserve. To my kids, Mick, Jessica and Rachel, for always letting me tell the stories. And to my wife, Kelly, for all of this and everything else. I couldn&#x2019;t love you more.</p><p><b>PROLOGUE</b></p><p>I am closer now, Sir Thomas.</p><p>Wherever you are, I believe you watch over me. And if such a thing is true, then you know how far I&#x2019;ve come. Though I cannot claim it was all my doing. My friends Robard and Maryam have remained steadfast, and in their own way they have carried the Grail as well. I know you ordered me to tell not a soul, but I could no longer let them risk their lives without knowing why. And I found, in their friendship and fierce loyalty, a much lighter step along a very perilous path.</p><p>I am tired.</p><p>More tired than I have ever been. So weary my bones ache at the very thought of moving. When we stood in the Knights Hall, back in Acre, and you handed me this leather satchel, which never leaves my side, you gave me no indication of how far I would travel. Back to England, yes, but a much longer journey for my soul.</p><p>I have seen things, Sir Thomas.</p><p>Death and pain and love and joy. And more than once I have wanted to curse your name. To throw my arms to heaven and ask,</p><p>&#x201c;Why me?&#x201d; Who is this Tristan of St. Alban&#x2019;s that made a Knight of the Temple believe he was ever capable of so grave a duty?</p><p>I still carry your sword, sire.</p><p>And, I am ashamed to say, I will one day stand before my maker and tell him I have wielded it in anger. With it, I have taken the lives of other men. Those who wished to kill me, no doubt, but the truth of it brings me no peace.</p><p>I will carry on, my liege.</p><p>Like the monks who raised me, I cannot bear the thought of disappointing you. Your face haunts my dreams. You trained me well, sire. But many times I worry you did not train me well enough.</p><p>I know the power of the Grail, Sir Thomas.</p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>(larsson).girl with the dragon tattoo</h2><p>A spellbinding amalgam of murder mystery, family saga, love story, and financial intrigue.... It's about the disappearance 40 years ago of Harriet Vanger, a young scion of one of the wealthiest families in Sweden...and about her octogenarian uncle, determined to know the truth about what he believes was her murder.<br><br> It's about Mikael Blomkvist, a crusading journalist recently at the wrong end of a libel case, hired to get to the bottom of Harriet's disappearance...and about Lisbeth Salander, a 24-year-old, pierced and tattooed genius hacker possessed of the hard-earned wisdom of someone twice her age, who assists Blomkvist with the investigation.<br><br> This unlikely team discovers a vein of nearly unfathomable iniquity running through the Vanger family, astonishing corruption in the highest echelons of Swedish industrialism - and an unexpected connection between themselves.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, September 2008</strong>: Once you start <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>, there's no turning back. This debut thriller--the first in a trilogy from the late Stieg Larsson--is a serious page-turner rivaling the best of Charlie Huston and Michael Connelly. Mikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist, watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him. Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch--and there's always a catch--is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. Little is as it seems in Larsson's novel, but there is at least one constant: you really <em>don't</em> want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo. --<em>Dave Callanan</em><br><br><b>Stieg Larsson</b> (1954-2004) was the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine Expo from 1999, and had previously worked at a major news agency for many years.

Working with documentary evidence and original interviews, the authors present an absorbing account of the machinations that got the arena and the adjacent Ice District built, with a price tag of more than $600 million. The arena deal, they argue, established a costly public financing precedent that people across North America should watch closely, as many cities consider building sports facilities for professional teams or international competitions. Their analysis brings clarity and nuance to a case shrouded in secrecy and understood by few besides political and business insiders. <i>Power Play</i> tells a dramatic story about clashing priorities where sports, money, and municipal power meet.</p><p>Big money and municipal politics collide in the story of Edmonton&#39;s Rogers Place hockey arena.Jay Scherer is Professor of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation and David Mills is a retired Professor of Canadian history, both from the University of Alberta.

They&#39;re as potent as a putrid peach. Listening to her words your head starts to droop with their sticky juice trickling down your ears, until all you can do is succumb to the saccharine flow.&#39; From one of South Korea&#39;s most acclaimed young authors comes the story of two sisters, Sora and Nana. When Sora was ten years old, and Nana was nine, their father died in a freak accident at the factory where he worked, his body sucked under a huge cogwheel, crushed beyond recognition. Their mother Aeja, numb with grief, gives in to torpor, developing an unhealthy obsession with the paradoxical violence implicit in life. Now adults, Sora finds herself dreaming of the past when she discovers that Nana is pregnant. Her initial reaction is shock though they live together, she never even realised her younger sister had a lover and Nana&#39;s icy response to her attempt at being considerate (&#39;You hate this, so don&#39;t pretend like I m some poor pregnant woman you have to pity&#39;) drives a wedge between the two. Can Naghi the boy who shared their childhood, and the simple, nourishing meals cooked by his mother help the sisters break free of Aeja&#39;s worldview in which life is ultimately futile and love is always doomed? A delicate stylist with an unflinching social gaze, in I&#39;ll Go On Hwang Jungeun has crafted a poignant novel with an uncanny ear for the unspoken secrets and heartaches buried beneath daily life and family ritual. Above all, it is a stunning exploration of the intensity of early bonds and the traces they leave on us as we grow up.</p><p></p><h2>The Kingdom: Arabia and the House of Sa&#39;Ud</h2><p><b>[This is the Audiobook CASSETTE Library Edition in vinyl case.]</b><br><br> [Read by Frederick Davidson]<br><br> <i>The Kingdom</i> is the story of a country -- a country of astonishing contrasts, where routine computer printouts open with the words ''In the name of God,'' where men who grew up in goat-hair tents now dominate the money markets of the world, and where murderers and adulterers are publicly executed in the street. By its own reckoning, this country is just entering the fifteenth century. <br><br> <i>The Kingdom</i> is also the story of a family -- a family that has fought its way from poverty and obscurity into wealth and power the likes of which the world has never known, a family characterized by fierce loyalty among its members, ruthlessness toward its enemies, and dedication to one of the world's most severe and demanding creeds. <br><br> <i>The Kingdom</i> is Saudi Arabia -- the only country in the world to bear the name of the family that rules it.</p><p>ROBERT LACEY is the coauthor of <i>The Year 1000</i> and the author of such bestselling books as <i>Majesty, The Kingdom</i>, and <i>The Queen Mother's Century</i>.

The sheer complexity of the material and the inaccessibility of Arabic nomenclature make this a very difficult book to present in audio. To keep facts straight, the listener needs the detailed appendices provided in the written format. Frederick Davidson&#39;s well-paced, crisp and forthright reading commands the listener&#39;s attention, and his able attempts at varied accents are welcome. Ironically, the supercilious edge to his voice reiterates the patronizing and dismissive attitude of the Western superpowers towards the Sa&#39;udis before the 1973 oil crisis. B.M.W.

In step-by-step illustrations, beloved author/illustrator Ralph Masiello shows kids how to use circles, ovals, and other shapes to draw simple, lifelike portraits of their favorite insects. From a beetle to a stink bug to a caterpillar, THE BUG DRAWING BOOK offers a wide range of insects that artists can bring to life as well as an invitation for artists to create their own imaginary creepy crawlers. The simple shapes and sequenced steps will encourage both confidence and creativity for artists at any level.</p><p>Ralph Masiello has illustrated many books, including THE ICKY BUG COUNTING BOOK, THE FLAGE WE LOVE, and his popular drawing series. He lives near Boston.Grade 1-4&#x2013;Would-be artists and entomologists will appreciate this book, which proposes that anyone can draw by breaking items into their basic shapes. From the ant to the stink bug, Masiello offers methods for sketching insects commonly found in North America. Each rendering begins with a simple shape delineated in red. As the drawing progresses, previous lines appear in black ink, while step-by-step changes and enhancements are in red. A boxed section shows optional detailed refinements that can be added to each image. The right-hand side of each spread contains a large, finished picture of the insect colored with a specified medium: marker, crayon, colored pencil, etc. Instructions for a caterpillar, chrysalis, and butterfly (a side view as well as a top view) provide help in understanding their life cycles. The resultant pictures are not strictly realistic, but they are not anthropomorphized cartoons, either. The book ends with an invitation to create imaginary insects. Children will find the simple shapes and coloration satisfying. Featuring pictures that are less complex than those in Lee J. Ames's "Draw 50..." series (Broadway), Masiello's title is a good choice for libraries needing easy how-to-draw materials.<i>&#x2013;Lynda Ritterman, Atco Elementary School, Waterford, NJ</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Rodrigue uses Blue Dog painting titles to provide insight&#x2014;whether humorous or nostalgic or sad&#x2014;into the human condition.<br>In an introduction, Rodrigue reveals how an idea that originated in childhood tales has now grown far beyond; his Blue Dogs have moved beyond Louisiana into formerly uncharted territory and now express larger concepts about contemporary life. His newer titles&#x2014;such as <i>Right Place Wrong Time</i> and <i>Tiffany Remembers the &#x2019;70s</i>&#x2014;along with other, more abstract ones such as <i>All by Myself with My Happiness</i> capture this shift in style and content.<br>But most of all, there are the paintings themselves, magnificently displayed, their titles inviting us to ask &#x201c;What is this dog all about?&#x201d; and &#x201c;What is the artist trying to say?&#x201d; Even though the definitive answers remain a mystery, the titles provide a clue...&nbsp;</p><p>The Blue Dog, created by George Rodrigue (1944-2013) is one of the most recognizable images in the world of contemporary art. Steeped in the legends and Cajun myths of Rodrigue's Louisiana upbringing, Blue Dog catapulted to worldwide fame in the early 1990s, and has never looked back. Featured in high-profile advertising campaigns (Absolut and Xerox) and on the set of TV's <i>Friends</i>, Blue Dog has been on an unprecedented journey&#x2014;from a single painting hung in Rodrigue's gallery in New Orleans to becoming an international pop icon.&nbsp;Four US presidents have commissioned portraits with Blue Dog, and Rodrigue's celebrity clients include Tom Brokaw, Whoopi Goldberg, Harry Connick Jr., and Sylvester Stallone.

Bonsai like you've never seen before-a "freestyle" version, in fun containers, that reflects the author's breakaway approach to this ancient art. <br><br><em>Pop Bonsai</em> involves taking a tiny seedling, trimming its branches and leaves, and wiring the trunk and branches to bend them into almost any style. The result: a living work of art, for next to no cost, to display as you like-in a ball of moss, on a can of beer, even in a pair of shoes or an eggcup! Naturally this does require some basic bonsai techniques, and advice on looking after plants. But in contrast to classical bonsai, where the aim is carefully to reproduce natural scenery in miniature, pop bonsai stresses the imagination and creativity of people living modern lives.<br><br>Throughout, <em>Pop Bonsai</em> takes a no-fuss approach. Almost any kind of tree or foliage plant can be used, and you're encouraged to grow it from scratch. Before starting, you are told what you should know about trees in general, with hints on choosing the right one for your purpose. Instructions on care and maintenance-soil, temperature, pruning, watering and fertilizers-are provided in a sensible, easy-to-follow way that should take the tension out of "gardening" even for those who have never tried it.<br><br>In your own home or on a balcony or at work, pop bonsai will let you enjoy the wonder of the changing seasons close-up, and remind you how precious and fragile life can be. But, cared for properly, your tree should live for decades. And in the process it will give you a taste of the enormous satisfaction to be gained from creating, and watching over, your own living work of art.</p><p><br>LISA TAJIMA attended college in the United States before returning to Japan to work for several years as a music journalist.

Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1892. Excerpt: ... GETTYSBURG. FIRST DAY. The battle of Gettysburg opened unexpectedly at half past nine in the morning of July 1st, by the advance of Heth&#39;s division of the enemy along the Cashtown road, northwest of town, where our cavalry under Buford met them and stubbornly resisted their progress, throwing their advance in confusion, holding the force in check until our infantry could get up, yet some three miles distant. The cavalry were dismounted and used as infantry, thus deceiving the enemy, while our batteries were managed with great effect. Gallantly did they maintain the unequal contest against the accumulating lines now hurrying forward, almost enveloping them. Gen. Reynolds commanding the right wing consisting of the 1st, 3d and 11th corps, on hearing the firing hurried ahead of his troops and quickly taking in the situation, urgently appealed to the hard-pressed cavalry to hold on a short time longer, until the infantry which were hurrying on, arrived; when he proceeded to make dispositions for them--dhrecting their course and placing them in position--and while so engaged, to the great loss to his country, and sorrow of the entire army, this grand officerin less than 30 minutes after his appearance at the front, was killed by a shot through his head. Thus fell one of the noblest spirits engaged in the Union cause, whose ability to command placed him among the foremost in the army. The Wisconsin company of Sharpshooters and the Michigan Company C had additional reason to regret his fall, for it was as before said this general, while we were serving with his command at Mechanicsville, who saved these companies from capture if not destruction, by personally coming to them to the front and warning them to immediately retire.

The first of his two volumes on the Enlightenment won a National Book Award; his best-selling Freud: A Life for Our Time, like his earlier Style in History, was a National Book Award finalist. He lives in Hamden, Connecticut.The fifth and concluding volume in Gay's reexamination of the 19th-century middle classes, this one focusing--with the author's customary grace and intelligence--on their attitudes toward the arts. The taste of the Victorian bourgeoisie is frequently disdained as conventional and sentimental, their involvement in activities like collecting paintings and attending concerts dismissed as efforts to enhance their status. Gay, emeritus professor of history at Yale, amply demonstrates that this is a gross oversimplification. ``Avant gardes could not have made their way without massive bourgeois patronage,'' he reminds us, profiling pioneering collectors like Russian merchant and Matisse patron Sergei Schukin, and French customs clerk Victor Chocquet, who championed C&#x201a;zanne. In chapters on the development of local symphonies, the rise of criticism as a profession, the differing blends of private enterprise and aristocratic patronage that financed arts institutions in various European and American cities, Gay does not deny that status-seeking played a part, nor that some bourgeois liked safe, insipid art. He simply wants his readers to recognize ``the rich diversity of bourgeois experience in the pleasure wars roiling the Victorian and post-Victorian arts,'' just as he asked them to reconsider the clich&#x201a; of all Victorians as sexually repressed in The Education of the Senses (1984), this series' first volume. Like its predecessors, Pleasure Wars is plausibly arranged rather than coherently organized, and Gay has a habit of announcing some obvious points as if they were revolutionary insights. But he is never less than readable, and he astutely weaves individual stories into a rich, complex tapestry. Sensitively depicting his 19th-century burghers grappling with the increasingly democratic nature of culture--and its funding--he reminds us that these issues are still contentious today. An appealing close to an unfailingly stimulating series that has more than fulfilled Gay's professed aim: ``to rise above melodrama to the far subtler drama that is history.'' -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The &#x201c;care of&#x201d; was a matter of some disagreement between Mma Ramotswe and Grace Makutsi, her assistant and &#x201c;right-hand lady,&#x201d; as she put it. Mma Makutsi, with all the dignity of one who had received ninety-seven per cent in the final examinations of the Botswana Secretarial College, took the view that to say that the agency was <i>care of </i>Speedy Motors was to diminish its importance, even if it was true that the agency occupied a small office at the side of the garage. Those who really counted in this life, she maintained, were usually not <i>care of</i> anybody.<br><br>&#x201c;We are the ones they come looking for,&#x201d; she argued, with perhaps less than perfect logic. &#x201c;When people come to this place, Mma, they look for us, not for the garage. The garage customers all know where the garage is. So our name should be first in the address, not the other way round, Mma. If anything, <i>Speedy Motors</i> should be care of us.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked at Mma Ramotswe as she said this, and then quickly added: &#x201c;That is not to say that Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and his garage are not important, Mma. That is not to say such a thing. It is just a question of . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Mma Ramotswe waited for her assistant to complete the sentence, but nothing further came. That was the trouble with Mma Makutsi, she thought; she left things hanging in the air, often the most important things. What was it a question of? It must be a question of status, she decided; Mma Makutsi could be very prickly about that. There had been that business about her being described as &#x201c;senior secretary&#x201d; when she had only been in the job for a couple of months and when there was nobody junior to her in the firm; in fact, when there was nobody else at all in the firm. Then, once she had been promoted to assistant detective, it had not been long before she had asked when she could expect to be an &#x201c;associate detective.&#x201d; That promotion had come, as had her earlier advancement, at a time when Mma Ramotswe had been feeling guilty about something or other and had felt the need to smooth ruffled feathers. But now that she was an associate detective it was difficult to see what the next step could be. She had a suspicion that Mma Makutsi hankered after the title of &#x201c;chief detective&#x201d;&#x2014;a suspicion which was founded on Mma Ramotswe&#x2019;s having found in the waste-paper basket a crumpled piece of paper on which Mma Makutsi had been trying out new signatures. Not only were there several attempts at <i>Mma Grace Radiphuti</i>, Radiphuti being the surname of her fiancï¿½, Phuti, but there was also a scrawled signature, <i>Grace Makutsi</i>, under which she had written <i>Chief Detective</i>.<br><br>Mma Ramotswe had re-crumpled the paper and tossed it back into the basket. She felt bad about having read it in the first place; one should not look uninvited at the papers of another, even if they have been discarded. And it was entirely understandable, normal even, that an engaged woman should practise the signature she will use after her marriage. Indeed, Mma Ramotswe suspected that most women secretly experimented with a new signature shortly after meeting a man they looked upon with favour&#x2014;even if that man had not expressed any interest in them. A handsome and eligible man might expect to have his name tried out in this way by many women who fancied themselves on his arm, and there was no harm in this, she thought, unless one believed that women should not prepare quite so willingly for their hearts to be broken. Women, thought Mma Ramotswe, are sometimes like plump chickens in the yard, while outside, circling the fence, were the hyenas, the men. It was not a happy way of envisaging the relation between the sexes, but time and time again she had seen this particular drama played out in exactly that way. And hyenas, one had to admit, were surely destined to break the hearts of chickens; they could do nothing else.<br><br>Mma Ramotswe saw nothing undignified in being in the care of anybody. In fact, she thought it was rather reassuring to be in another&#x2019;s care and, more than that, it was a very convenient way of describing how to find somebody, a way which we used in our everyday lives when talking about those we knew. There were people who were always to be found in the company of one particular friend, and to say, &#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;ll always find him walking around with that other man, you know, the one who lives next to the store,&#x201d; was surely the same as saying that one was care of the other. Yes, we were all care of one another in the final analysis, at least in Botswana, where people looked for and valued those invisible links that connected people, that made for belonging. We were all cousins, even if remote ones, of somebody; we were all friends of friends, joined together by bonds that you might never see, but that were there, sometimes every bit as strong as hoops of steel.<br><br>But, Mma Ramotswe thought that morning as she drank her first cup of red bush tea during her walk about her garden, perhaps this did not apply to everybody; perhaps there were some who were lonely in the middle of all this profusion of friends and relatives, who had lost their people. And that very morning, she would be seeing a woman who had written to her with exactly that problem, a woman who wanted to trace her relatives. Tracing people was bread and butter to somebody in Mma Ramotswe&#x2019;s profession; at least once a month someone would come into the office and ask her to find somebody&#x2014;an errant husband, a lover, a child who had drifted away from the family and stopped writing home. Sometimes it was lawyers who contacted her and asked her to find those who stood to inherit cattle, or land, and did not know of the good fortune that awaited them. That was the sort of case that Mma Ramotswe most enjoyed, and when she succeeded in finding such people, as she usually did, she relished the moment when she disclosed to them what was in store. Earlier that week she had found a young man who did not know that his uncle in the north had died and left him three trucks and a taxi. She had forgiven him the speed with which his expression of sorrow at the news of the uncle&#x2019;s demise was replaced by one of incredulity and then joy when he heard of the vehicles awaiting him under a shade-netting awning somewhere up in Maun. Young men were human, after all, and this young man, she learned, had been saving to build a small house for himself and his bride-to-be. He needed to save no more.<br><br>&#x201c;Three trucks, did you say, Mma? What make?&#x201d;<br><br>Mma Ramotswe had no idea. Trucks were Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni&#x2019;s concern, not hers. She was not even sure she could identify the manufacturer of her tiny white van; there had been a name painted on the back at one stage, but over the years it had been obliterated by the wind and clouds of dust and the scratching of thorn bushes. Now there was nothing, just ridges in the metal where there had been letters. Not that it mattered, of course: the tiny white van was too old to remember its maker, too ancient to be taken back.<br><br>Missing names, missing persons&#x2014;how remarkable it was, she thought, that we managed to anchor ourselves at all in this world, and that we did so by giving ourselves names and linking those names with places and other people. But there were people, she imagined, whose names said nothing about them and who had only the haziest idea of who they were, people who might never even have known their parents. Mma Ramotswe could not remember her mother, who died when she was a baby, but at least she had known her father, the late Obed Ramotswe, whose memory seemed undimmed by the passage of the years. She thought of him every day, every day, and believed that in due course&#x2014;but not too soon, she hoped&#x2014;she would see him again in that place that was Botswana but not Botswana, that place of gentle rain and contented cattle. And perhaps on that day those people who had nobody here would find that there were indeed people for them.

The way in which she captures wildlife and livestock and the changing seasons and skies is particularly noteworthy. In contrast, Bannatyne-Cugnet's alliterative text is lame and labored. She seems to have struggled to find words beginning with the appropriate letters, and to place them in comprehensible sentences. By far the weakest part of the book is the list of words for objects that appear in the illustrations and that begin with the given letter. Suggestions range from the expected ("ducks" for the letter "D") to the nearly incomprehensible ("university shirt" for the letter "U" and "foot mark" for the letter "M"). Explanations for each of the scenes follow; information about living and farming in this region is explained in clear prose. These tidbits are interesting and useful to researchers in the higher grades. --Lucinda Lockwood, Thomas Haney Secondary School, Maple Ridge, BC<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Endless Catacombs (Endless Quest Book No 22)</h2><p>The reader&#39;s decisions will determine whether he or she can remove the powerful curse of the wizard from the dangerous, subterranean world of the Endless Catacombs</p><p></p><h2>How to Draw and Paint Cats (from the How to Draw and Paint Series)</h2><p>Walter T.

He lives in West Sussex, England.The Tin man asked, &#x201c;Are they coming?&#x201d; and reached for his revolver.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His sister Emily made no response. She stood at a bedroom window of Falmouth House, near Newmarket, staring down at the curve of the gravel drive between the lawns. It was Monday afternoon, 8 November, 1886, about twenty past two. She made no response because she didn&#x2019;t understand the question. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was bone-weary, but profoundly relieved that her brother had rallied after a frightening weekend. On Thursday evening he had come back from the races at Lewes complaining of a feverish chill. Next day his temperature had soared dangerously. Two doctors had seen him, and a nurse from Cambridge had been engaged. Not until Sunday evening had his temperature started to drop. Last night, thank heaven, he had slept. This morning he had sat up in bed when his regular doctor called. His temperature was right down. Some of his friends had called to see him and he had chatted happily. A few minutes ago he had told Emily to send the nurse for lunch.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&#x201c;Are they coming?&#x201d; </i>What did he mean by that?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emily heard a sound behind her. She turned.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tin man was out of bed and striding toward the open door in his nightshirt. He had the gun in his left hand.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emily&#x2019;s throat contracted. She put her hand to her neck and cried out, &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; She darted across the room toward him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He backed against the door and it slammed shut.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She froze.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had lifted the gun and pointed it toward his own face.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until such a crisis occurs, nobody can know how they will react. Emily fought her paralyzing fear, flung out her arm and tried to stop him. She succeeded in pushing the gun aside. He grabbed her with his right arm, gripped her around the neck and thrust her against the door. They wrestled for what seemed like a minute.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shrieked repeatedly for help.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tightened the grip. Emily&#x2019;s arms flailed uselessly. Considering how ill her brother had been, his strength was extraordinary, superhuman. He held her on his right side while he turned his face to the left and moved the muzzle to his mouth. She was powerless to stop him. She could only scream. He spoke no other words. He pulled the trigger and the shot hurled him backward. He hit the floor.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sobbing hysterically, Emily staggered across the room and tugged at the bell-rope.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were they coming? It no longer mattered to the Tin man.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> CHAPTER 2<br> <i>Sandringham</i><br> 31 December, 1886<br> &nbsp;<br> I must say, it&#x2019;s a queer thing to be sitting in my study on the last day of 1886, addressing someone not yet born, but that is what I take you to be. That is what you had <i>better </i>be. As for me, I am a dead man, or will be when you read this. And grossly libeled in the history books, I shouldn&#x2019;t wonder.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to prolong the mystification, my name is Albert Edward, and among other things notable and notorious, I am the Prince of Wales, the eldest son of Her Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria. To please Mother and Country, I wear a straitjacket. This uncongenial garment is known as protocol. It obliges me to consign this intimate account of certain adventures of mine to a secure metal box in the Public Record Office for a hundred years. So I can confidently inform you that I am dead. As are all the other poor, benighted spirits I shall presently raise.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good day to you, then. Not a bad day to commence putting pen to paper. Christmas festivities over; too much fog about for shooting; flat-racing finished for the year; and a certain lady who has been known to make agreeable incursions upon my time and energy is occupied for a season on the New York stage.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In case it surprises you that the Heir Apparent&#x2019;s waking hours are not filled with official engagements, allow me to state that I do my share of laying foundation stones, inspecting lines of guardsmen and handing prizes to clever dicks in universities. I do my share and the Queen&#x2019;s as well, for it&#x2019;s no secret that the Empress of India practices her own variety of <i>purdah. </i>The year of 1887 will be the fiftieth of her reign, her Golden Jubilee, and who do you think is acting as host? The royal families of four continents will be in attendance, and my most daunting task is to persuade the principal subject of all the rejoicing to emerge from her drawing room at Windsor for an afternoon.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a job! Like putting up a tiger without elephants or beaters.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steady, Bertie. This is a memoir, not a letter of complaint.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was seven weeks ago that I was given the shocking news that prompted me to turn detective. Yes, <i>detective. </i>Does that surprise you? It surprised me. I wouldn&#x2019;t have dreamed of such an eventuality until it grabbed me by the beard and fairly hauled me out of my armchair. Yet now that I reflect upon it, I see that my unique position fitted me admirably for the challenge.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the afternoon of 8 November, 1886, the first report reached London by wire from Newmarket that Fred Archer had killed himself. You cannot imagine the sensation this caused. Archer, the greatest jockey ever to grace the Turf&#x2014;and I am confident that you, a century on, will know his name, even though you have never seen his like&#x2014;had blown his brains out with a revolver bullet. He was twenty-nine years old. This year he had won his fifth Derby, his twenty-first Classic.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How shall I convey the shock that devastated the nation?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archer was a legend. Crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of him wherever he appeared. Women he had never met pressed passionate letters into his hand. Every owner in the kingdom wanted to retain him. He rubbed shoulders with the highest in the land. Well, the second highest, at any rate&#x2014;Mama not being a frequenter of race courses. Here, I must own to a personal interest. In April, 1886, Archer rode a doughty little filly by the name of Counterpane to victory in a Maiden Plate at Sandown Park: my first-ever winner on the flat. We were given a rousing ovation from the public. Sadly, two weeks later, Counterpane broke a blood vessel and dropped dead. I bore it with philosophy, yet looking back, I wonder if my filly&#x2019;s untimely fate presaged the tragedy that befell her rider.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am told that when the dreadful news of Archer reached London, Fleet Street was impassable for the crowds massed outside the principal newspaper offices. Special editions of the evening papers carrying the bare statement that the great jockey was dead sold out in minutes. Extra-special editions were printed and the sheets were snatched unfolded from the bundles faster than the boys could hand them out.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It chanced that the day following, 9 November, was the forty-fifth anniversary of my birth. As usual, flags were hoisted across the land, gun salutes were fired and church bells rang out peals at intervals from an early hour, but the gun crews and the bell ringers might as well have stayed in bed for all the attention my birthday received. One topic, and one alone, engrossed the nation. In the city, members of the Stock Exchange fought with umbrellas for the first edition of <i>The Times.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who obtained a copy read in the leading article, &#x201c;A great soldier, a great statesman, a great poet, even a Royal Prince, might die suddenly without giving half so general a shock as has been given by the news of the tragical death of Fred Archer, the jockey.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How true! I was as shaken as any man, although I cannot forbear from pointing out that the remark about a Royal Prince was in deplorable taste, particularly on my birthday. One never knows what unpleasant shocks lurk unsuspected in the newspapers. I still bristle at the memory of learning in 1876 from <i>The Times of India </i>of the proposal to confer the title of Empress on my mother. Neither she nor Disraeli (who accepted his own earldom the same year) had thought fit to tell me about the Royal Titles Bill, and I protested vigorously to both, I promise you. In no other country in the world would the next heir to the throne have been treated with such disregard.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding my misgivings about the press, I wanted to know about Archer. I turned out before breakfast and pedaled my tricycle furiously up the drive at Sandringham to meet the delivery boy. Gave him a shock, I fancy. I didn&#x2019;t read the remarks in <i>The Times </i>at that juncture. It was all graphically reported in that more congenial organ, <i>The Sporting Life.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Many happy returns of the day, Bertie, my dear,&#x201d; piped my first lady as I repaired to the breakfast room. Dear Alix had made an exceptional effort to be on parade. I can reveal to posterity that the Princess of Wales is not noted for punctuality.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The table was heaped with presents in brightly colored boxes tied with ribbon. A jug of Duminy, extra sec, was by my place and a servant hovered for my order. Alix was cooing like a basket of pigeons.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;My birthday is blighted,&#x201d; I informed her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must explain that Alix was not aware at this juncture of the tragic tidings from Newmarket. The previous evening, she had retired early. I was entertaining certain of my birthday guests until late. I heard the news of Archer from Knollys, my secretary, about 1:30 a.m.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alix turned pale. She is inclined to anemia, anyway, and now she was more starched than the tablecloth. &#x201c;Not another scandal, Bertie?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Absolutely not. The very notion,&#x201d; I protested in an outraged tone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Then what can have happened?&#x201d; She put her hand to her collar as another thought occurred. &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;tell me it isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;bad news from Windsor.&#x201d; Inopportunely, a hint of color returned to her cheeks.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So far as I&#x2019;m aware, Mama is in the pink of health,&#x201d; I answered coolly, and then repeated, &#x201c;The pink of health.&#x201d; (Alix is rather deaf.) &#x201c;&#x2019;Long to reign over us,&#x2019; as the Anthem perpetually reminds one.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sighed slightly and leaned back. &#x201c;What, then?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tossed her <i>The Sporting Life.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&#x201c;Took his own life?&#x201d; </i>she read aloud in that Danish chant of hers that makes everything she says sound like Little Jack Horner. &#x201c;What an unexpected thing to do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Due to an aberration of the brain, if the report is to be believed,&#x201d; I explained. &#x201c;The poor fellow was apparently suffering the effects of typhoid.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Apparently. </i>You sound skeptical.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I am,&#x201d; I admitted, adding in a measured voice, &#x201c;I am not unacquainted with the symptoms.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course, my dearest,&#x201d; Alix affirmed with eyes lowered, doubtless recalling how my father, Prince Albert, rest his soul, died of the dread disease and I myself had practically succumbed to it when I was thirty.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a rapid summation that saved her the trouble of reading further. &#x201c;It seems that yesterday morning Archer was pronounced better and was speaking normally to his friends and family. Sometime early in the afternoon, at Archer&#x2019;s own suggestion, the nurse left the room to get some lunch. Mrs. Coleman, his sister, remained in the bedroom. She crossed the room to look out of the window, and Archer got up from the bed with a revolver in his hand. She ran to him and struggled with him, but he put it to his mouth and shot himself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Dreadful,&#x201d; said Alix.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Rum </i>is the description I would use,&#x201d; said I. &#x201c;I shall cogitate on this.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sent word to the chef to prepare a full breakfast, as for a day&#x2019;s shooting. That is to say, bacon and eggs, and plenty of them, followed by Finnan haddock, followed by chicken, followed by toast and butter, helped down with plenty of coffee. With me, breakfast has to be like the evil thereof in the Bible: sufficient unto the day. I had a strong premonition that this day would make heavy demands on my constitution.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breakfast was not long in coming, or going. I eat swiftly, and with relish.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To please Alix, I unwrapped a box of Corona y Coronas and a pair of carpet slippers that she unsportingly informed me were exclusively for use in my bedroom at Sandringham, and then I was left to ponder further the strange suicide of Frederick James Archer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typhoid?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can vouch for its dramatic effect upon body and brain. When it poleaxed me, toward the end of 1871, I was delirious for days. I am told that I shouted at my attendants, hurled pillows across the room and broke into songs of the sort that you won&#x2019;t find in the English hymnal. Poor Alix had to be restrained from staying in the room with me on account of certain names I uttered in my ravings. Once she tried to enter secretly on hands and knees, and I felled her with a pillow. I was quite oblivious of my conduct, you understand. Even my devoted Mama the Queen was obliged to shelter behind a screen. I hovered between life and death for weeks on end. As the poet dramatically expressed it:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the wires, the electric message came:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He is no better; he is much the same.&#x201d;</p><h2>Perfecting Sound Forever: An Aural History of Recorded Music</h2><p>In 1915, Thomas Edison proclaimed that he could record a live performance and reproduce it perfectly, shocking audiences who found themselves unable to tell whether what they were hearing was an Edison Diamond Disc or a flesh-and-blood musician. Today, the equation is reversed. Whereas Edison proposed that a real performance could be rebuilt with absolute perfection, Pro Tools and digital samplers now allow musicians and engineers to create the illusion of performances that never were. In between lies a century of sonic exploration into the balance between the real and the represented.Tracing the contours of this history, Greg Milner takes us through the major breakthroughs and glorious failures in the art and science of recording.

He lives in Brooklyn.Perfecting Sound Forever <br> Acoustic/Electrical 1 The Point of Commencement The chain reaction began in the White House. Shortly before noon on February 20, 1915, Franklin K. Lane, the secretary of the interior, was concluding his remarks in praise of the pioneer spirit, in front of 50,000 people who had gathered at the Tower of Jewels in San Francisco to wait for the start of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. "The waste places of the Earth have been found and filled, but adventure is not at an end," Lane said. "Here will be taught the gospel of an advancing democracy--strong, valiant, confident, conquering--upborne and typified by the important spirit of the American pioneer." When he finished, a telegram was sent to President Woodrow Wilson. This was Wilson's cue to press a key covered with gold nuggets, which completed an electrical circuit over a telegraph line with a navy radio telegraphy station in Tuckerton, New Jersey. A relay key was automatically activated, causing powerful electrical waves to emanate from an 835-foot tower. They traveled across the continent and were received by two antennas 400 feet above the ground, on top of the Tower of Jewels. From there, the current traveled through insulated wires to a delicate receiver in the grandstand, near the speaker's platform. The receiver activated another electrical signal that traveled through the expo grounds. It opened the door of Machinery Hall, made water flow from the Fountain of Energy, and triggered several explosions. Back at the White House, Wilson's guests, who included the California congressional delegation and several members of his cabinet, burst into applause. Wilson himself was more reflective. He said, "This appeals to the imagination, rather than to the eye." The Tower of Jewels was the centerpiece of San Francisco's new walled city, carved out of 635 acres and 76 square blocks, for which 200 buildings had been demolished. The irony of this urban clear-cutting was that although the expo officially commemorated the opening of the Panama Canal, everyone knew its real purpose was to celebrate the rebirth of San Francisco from the ashes of the devastating 1906 earthquake. To do so, the city had effaced itself once more, beating nature at its own game, just as surely as the Panama project had laughed at geography. The expo's city was right on the bay, a setting that had been carefully chosen for its symbolism. "It will be set actually beside salt water," William D'Arcy Ryan, one of the fair's planners, had declared in 1913, "on the ultimate frontier of the race's march eastward from its cradle in Asia, on the final coast where only the sea intervenes between it and what the surveyors call 'the point of commencement.'" Uniting the oceans in Panama, building a city on a restless fault line--progress obeyed no frontiers. One local reporter called the expo nothing less than "the height of the tide of modern civilization," like the canal itself "an idea that was really a product of the consciousness of the whole West." The Palace of Machinery and the Palace of Fine Arts occupied opposite edges of the grounds, symbolizing the expo's exhaustive celebration of science and industry, art and culture. Measuring 1,000 feet long and 136 feet high, and containing a fully functioning industrial plant, the Palace of Machinery was the world's largest building forged from wood and steel. The expo's largest exhibit, built by U.S. Steel, followed the path of iron ore as it was wrested from the mines and forged into steel. When fairgoers grew tired of the relentless march of progress, they could retire to the Joy Zone, site of all manner of amusements, including the Bowls of Joy, a terrifying attraction that launched riders around the inner surface of two enormous cones. The Joy Zone also pointedly contained many of the exhibits devoted to non-Western cultures, such as the Mysterious Orient. The expo felt global in scope during the day, but thanks to Ryan, the director of General Electric's illumination lab, it was otherworldly at night. Angled lights concealed in foliage threw beams off the palaces at skewed angles. Submerged lights made the pools on the Court of the Universe glow an eerie green, while statues of the "rising sun" and the "setting sun" were lit on top of sixty-foot poles. The fountains of the Court of the Ages were adorned with serpents that appeared to spit green steam. Out in the bay, abattalion of U.S. Marines operated the Scintillator: forty-eight searchlights in seven different colors that shone through a veil of steam created by an actual locomotive, imitating the aurora borealis in the sky above the city. The real center of light was the Tower of Jewels, hung with 102,000 actual jewels, barely visible during the day but breathtaking at night. These Novagems--cut glass in ruby, emerald, white, pink, purple, and aquamarine--swung in the breeze from the bay, refracting the beams of strategically placed lights. Each night, crowds gathered to witness "the burning of the Tower." Red lights mixed with fires lit along the colonnades to make the metal structure look like it was melting, a graphic reminder of the city that burned in 1906. The Panama-Pacific Expo took over San Francisco for ten months in 1915, and then simply vanished. Every structure was razed, except for the Palace of Fine Arts and its weird staircases to nowhere. The demolition was the expo's final symbolic act, the planners' ultimate demonstration that the fair was barely corporeal, more like the hallucinatory product of a collective dream. (William Saroyan, who visited the fair as a child, remembered it as "a place that could not possibly be real.") During those ten months, 18 million people visited the expo. They came not just to see palaces and exhibits but also to catch appearances by famous Americans. William Howard Taft, Teddy Roosevelt, and George Washington Goethals--the famous "canal genius" who oversaw the work in Panama--attracted huge crowds, but one man outdrew them all. He was the man without whom those Novagems might have twisted in a dark night, "a white-haired man of peace," in the gushing words of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, "epitomizing more in industrial achievement than any other in the world's history." &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> It was billed as Edison Day--Thursday, October 21--a celebration of the thirty-sixth anniversary of Thomas Alva Edison's invention of the incandescent lamp. By 1:30 in the afternoon, ninety minutes before Edison was to be honored in Festival Hall (home of the world's second-largest pipe organ), its 4,000 seats were filled, leaving 10,000 people stranded in the streets outside. "From the day that he first made an incandescent lamp glow," Charles Moore announced from the stage, "his name has been stamped on history'spages in a plane by himself. It is fitting that he should come here and we should burn incense to him." As Moore read a series of telegrammed tributes, Edison, by this point in his life nearly completely deaf, whispered to his wife, "I'm glad I can't hear him. I'd feel so foolish." When Moore finished speaking, it was time for Edison to receive an honorary medal. As his wife attempted to pull stray threads off his coat, Edison rose and walked slowly to the stage, trailed by Thomas Insull, his secretary. The crowd was surprised to discover that Edison had nothing to say to them. That had been one of his conditions for participating in this tribute, that he not have to say a word. Instead, he let Insull do the talking. As Insull delivered a speech praising his boss, Edison sat with his head down, occasionally cracking a small smile. When it was over, as he left the hall, a riot nearly broke out, as people jumped over barricades and sprinted past guards to try to shake the old man's hand. (In the confusion, Edison somehow lost his hat.) He was driven to the Court of the Universe, where he was named Man of the Century. Then it was on to the AT&amp;T exhibit at the Palace of Liberal Arts. Back in West Orange, New Jersey, where it was already evening, 162 of Edison's friends and family were gathered at his home, waiting for a connection to San Francisco to be made over the recently completed transcontinental telephone line. Outside, 5,000 tiny lights were strung along the street, and spotlights swept the sky. Edison perked up a little. He'd been looking forward to this part of the day, ever since Miller Reese Hutchinson, the chief engineer at Edison Laboratories, had come up with a novel way to show off the Edison Diamond Disc Phonograph. At 5:15 on the West Coast, 8:15 in the East, the chief engineer of Edison Labs announced from West Orange, "Mr. Edison is on the wire." The guests in West Orange picked up telephone receivers fastened to their chairs and heard Edison confirm the connection. Hutchinson delivered a speech without opening his mouth or tapping a telegraph. He'd prerecorded it onto a Diamond Disc, which he now placed on a phonograph next to his phone. The disc spun and Hutchinson's voice was heard: <br> We are all distinctly Edison. This address, for instance, is being made to you by your greatest favorite, the Edison Diamond Disc Phonograph. An Edison Granular Carbon Telephone Transmitter istransforming the sound waves into electrical impulses which, after following the tortuous paths of copper beneath rivers and bays, over valleys, deserts, plains and mountains, are being reproduced in San Francisco as articulate speech ... By the invention of your friend, Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, speech may now be transmitted all over the world, and through the intermediary of your invention, the Edison Diamond Disc, permanent records are being made of the voices of great statesmen, wonderful human songbirds and the renditions of famous musicians, all of which will be transmitted down the ages to future generations of men and women whose great-grandsires have not, as yet, been born. <br> As Edison's engineer in West Orange monitored the transmission of his own voice, after every few lines he would announce to the guests, "Mr. Edison is hearing it perfectly." When it was over, for the first time in two days, Edison had words for those who honored him. He leaned over the phone, and spoke loud and clear: <br> It may seem strange to those who know my work on the telephone carbon transmitter that this is the first time I have ever carried on a conversation over the telephone. Trying to talk 3,400 miles on my first attempt at conversation seems to be a pretty big undertaking, but the engineers of the Bell System have made it easier to talk 3,400 miles than it used to be to talk 34 miles. In my research work I have spent a great many years listening to the phonograph, but it gives me a singular sensation to sit here in California and hear the new Diamond Disc Phonograph over the telephone all the way from Orange, New Jersey. I heard the record of Hutch's talk very plainly. I should now like to hear a musical record. If you have one handy, I wish you would play Anna Case's bird song. <br> Hutchinson did happen to have a record handy. He had been told by Edison to be prepared to play some music by Case. After removing the disc with his speech from the phonograph, Hutchinson put on a Case record. Case's voice traveled that tortuous path of copper beneath the rivers and the bays, over the valleys and deserts and plains and mountains, through the phone, and into Edison's crippled ear. As the music played, word wentback to West Orange, this time in the ghost language of the telegraph's dots and dashes, so as not to interrupt the music: "Mr. Edison is hearing it perfectly." Edison looked like he was enjoying himself for the first time in days. All the paeans to progress that surrounded him, all the Novagems and the lights that made them shine, and all Thomas Alva Edison wanted to do was listen to a record. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> "The phonograph knows more about us than we know ourselves," Edison had declared back in 1888. For someone who had a preternatural ability to give the world what it needed, this was a striking admission. The phonograph was a puzzle. Unlike the telegraph or the incandescent lamp, it solved no apparent problem, fulfilled no apparent need. It was a blank slate awaiting a use and an ideology--"an invention, pure and simple," Edison said. The first of Edison's creations to work in its first incarnation, the phonograph entered the world nearly fully formed, waiting for its secrets to be unlocked. "This is my baby," Edison announced, "and I expect it to grow up to be a big feller in my old age." But doing what, exactly? Not necessarily recording and playing music. Edison, who designed the phonograph to record as well as reproduce sounds, assumed the natural purpose of the machine would be as a dictation aid. What ideas Edison did have regarding the phonograph's musical applications had little or nothing to do with music as a prerecorded commercial object. Most of his proposed uses--recording the voices of loved ones and famous people, teaching elocution, early versions of answering machines and books on tape--emphasized the act of preserving information, with little regard to how that information actually sounded. Fidelity wasn't the goal; permanence was. In the courtroom, the phonograph would bear witness to someone's <i>exact</i> testimony. A document would remain forever unaltered: "As it may be filed away as other letters, and at any subsequent time reproduced, it is a perfect <i>record</i>." For a brief moment, Edison's phonograph was a sensation, the invention that made Edison a real celebrity outside of the scientific community. Unlike his other creations, Edison liked to demonstrate the phonograph himself in public, in front of audiences that included Congress and President Rutherford B. Hayes. But the fledgling Edison Speaking PhonographCompany did poor business. Stenographers and secretaries found the phonograph unwieldy, tinfoil was a flimsy recording medium, and the sound of recordings, shaky to begin with, quickly decayed with subsequent uses. Once the initial hoopla had died, the phonograph was still a novelty, a "pure invention." Edison put it on the shelf, where it sat for the next ten years. He never forgot about it, though. Although he put most of his energy toward developing the electric light, Edison continued to brainstorm ideas for developing the phonograph. Meanwhile, Alexander Graham Bell took up some of the slack, conducting phonographic experiments of his own, which culminated with his invention, in 1886, of the suspiciously titled Graphophone. Feeling territorial, Edison resumed work on his phonograph, insisting that Bell's work had nothing to with his renewed interest. In 1888, Edison emerged with an improved phonograph. Edison still thought the phonograph's primary function would be preservation of sounds, but he was beginning to consider the possibility that many of these preserved sounds would be music. He imagined that "in the far-off future, when our descendants wish to conjure our simple little Wagner operas with the complex productions of their days, requiring, perhaps, a dozen orchestras playing in half-a-dozen keys at once, they will have an accurate phonographic record of our harmonic simplicity." A memo sent by Edison's aide William H. Meadowcroft reveals the company's evolving conception of what the machine could do: "It seems to me that your Phonograph ought to be absolutely invaluable to professional singers, for the reason they can study the effect of their own singing. ...</p><h2>The Robot Collection</h2><p>Human detective Elijah Baley and his robot partner, Daneel Olivaw, solve two murders, and other robots and people face the strange situations and challenges of living and working together</p><p></p><h2>The General Retires and Other Stories</h2><p>When it first appeared in 1987, the title story of this collection of stories by Nguyen Huy Thiep caused a sensation in Vietnam. Not since the Communist revolution had readers found as stark and compelling a view of their world as <em>The General Retires</em> offered them. Written in spare, succinct prose, it captures the despair of an old general who, after many years of devoted service to his country, is alienated by the emptiness of the society into which he retires and ultimately flees. Nguyen probes similar themes in the stories that follow, from <em>Cun</em>, the moving tale of a crippled beggar, to <em>A Drop of Blood</em>, a dark history of a family set against decades of war and revolution. With eight powerfully written stories--all available in English for the first time--and including an introduction by Greg Lockhart that traces the varied traditions of Vietnamese literature to the present day, this collection offers unprecedented insight into a society trying to overcome and understand years of pain and civil strife.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Nguyen Huy Thiep</strong> is a writer living in Ho Chi Minh City.<br> <em>About the Translator</em>:<br> <strong>Greg Lockhart</strong> teaches at the University of New South Wales, Australia.<br>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Vietnamese</p><h2>How I Planned Your Wedding: The All-True Story of a Mother and Daughter Surviving the Happiest Day of Their Lives</h2><p><br><br>Bestselling author Susan Wiggs literally wrote the book on happily-ever-after love.

In February. In the Pacific Northwest. After thawing herself out, the author put on her lipstick and vacuumed the living room. Why? Because on the tiny island where she lives, news travels fast. She knew her girlfriends would show up momentarily - which they did - with the customary champagne and bags of Cheetos. She toasted her loyal readers, whose unflagging interest in her books propelled her sales upward. She toasted her friends and family as well, since they have always been the source of her inspiration. From the very start, her writings have illuminated the everyday dramas of ordinary people. At the age of eight, she self-published her first novel, entitled A Book About Some Bad Kids. Today, she is an international best-selling author, with millions of copies of her books in print in numerous countries. Her Lakeshore Chronicles novels celebrate the power of love, the timeless bonds of family and the nuances of human nature that make headlines every day. She lives on an island in the Pacific Northwest and is perpetually working on her next novel.I was born to be a bride. There are family photographs of me in a bridal gown dating all the way back to age two. Even in my imagination, every detail was precisely arranged&#x2014;the flowers, the veil, the tiara, the sparkly shoes, the smear of lipstick across my mouth. But in those little-girl fantasies, there was one small missing detail: the groom.<br><br>Ten, senior year of college, the heavens opened up, angels sang from on high and one tipsy night I found myself alone with Dave. I'd seen him around school before (after all, there were only 1,500 students at our tiny liberal arts college), but something about him was...different. Specifically, he looked like a god. Over the summer, he'd grown his glossy, blond hair past his shoulders and had sprouted an extra six inches in height, taking him to a towering 6-foot-4. Pair that with his gracefully lean cross-country runner's body and I'd bagged myself the offspring of Brad Pitt and a Thomson's gazelle.<br><br>During that first fateful night in his dorm room when we had, ahem, chastely chatted from opposite ends of the futon, he asked if I wanted to brush my teeth, to which I replied "Hell, yes" because, you know, stale cheap beer breath isn't the most romantic thing in the world. As soon as our pearly whites were clean and fresh, Dave looked at me and began slowly leaning in, a gentlemanly question in his eyes, waiting for my signal that, yes, he could now storm the citadel on his steed, breaching the gates of my...well, you know. I'm not one for subtlety, so I grabbed him by the ears and yanked him into the make-out session to end all make-out sessions. And that's about all I'm going to say about <i>that, </i>Dear Readers. I'm collaborating with my <i>mother </i>on this project, after all.<br><br>As it turns out, that was the <i>last </i>"first" kiss I would ever share with a man, though I didn't know it at the time. I certainly hoped so, because it was <i>that </i>magical, the kiss that erased all others. The defining smooch. The zing of chemistry between Dave and me was palpable. After growing up under the wing of a bestselling writer, I finally, <i>finally </i>understood what my mom's books were really about&#x2014;and why they're so addictive to so many readers. Dave and I spent countless hours talking and cracking each other up, falling under that magical spell that has launched a million romance novels.<br><br>Exactly three years, seven months and twenty-two days later, I would kiss this same dude in a sunlit, fountain-fed atrium full of our family and friends: our first kiss as husband and wife. But between that first Pabst Blue Ribbon-fueled make-out session and the moment we sealed our marriage with a kiss, we had a mountain to climb. A mountain of friggin' insane wedding planning that would, no matter how we fought it, be heavily supervised and directed by a woman who creates over-the-top, happily-ever-after romance for a living: my mom.<br><br>SUSAN<br><br>Of all the dreams I ever dreamed for my daughter, the biggest one was the dream in which she finds the one person in the world who will love her for the rest of her life. Because, after all, love in all its forms gives life its meaning. I've always believed that. I'd <i>better </i>believe that. I've made a career out of it, after all.<br><br>But when it comes to real-world matters, there's a deeper reason for wanting your child to spend the rest of her days with the love of her life. It's the one secret you can't tell her. She has to find out for herself. A lasting love is the deepest of life's joys.<br><br>When Elizabeth was very little, and people asked what she wanted to be when she grew up, she didn't say a teacher or a doctor, an artist or a sales clerk or a hot-air balloon pilot.<br><br>She would tell them, "A bride."<br><br>My friends would offer pitying looks. "I'm so sorry. She'll grow out of it. She'll realize that what she really wants is to be a rocket scientist or a chef or a choreographer."<br><br>I didn't really need their pity, and I wasn't bothered by her oft-stated aspiration. As a romance writer, I never quibbled with her dream. Of course she wanted to be a bride. She wanted to find the man of her dreams and live happily ever after.<br><br>Is there any higher calling? Any bigger dream?<br><br>And so I let her fantasy grow and develop, unimpeded by other people's expectations or even common sense. The vision was embellished with horse-drawn carriages made of crystal, a banquet consisting of nothing but French toast, Skittles and spun sugar, a ball gown so elaborate it wouldn't even fit through doorways. The bride would be attended by her best and most beautiful friends, including her Airedale terrier.<br><br>When it came time to plan her actual wedding, this vision stayed more or less intact. Sure, the horse-drawn carriage morphed into a white stretch limo, complete with glittering disco lights in the ceiling, and the family dog had gone over the rainbow bridge, but overall, her dream came true&#x2014;the gown, the beautiful friends, the hair, the pearls.<br><br>But where does that leave me, the mom?<br><br>I'm not quite sure how to say this, so I'll be blunt. Does anybody actually dream about being the <i>mother </i>of the bride?<br><br>Come on. That's kind of like getting stuck with Midge&#x2014;the sidekick&#x2014;while playing Barbies. It's also sure to mess with your denial about exactly how old you are.<br><br>Hello? You are now old enough to actually have a daughter who's getting married. A new generation has come along, and here you thought <i>you </i>were the young generation. You didn't even notice the runner behind you, reaching forward to pass you the baton.<br><br>Deal with it. No, do better than that. Embrace it. And don't forget to savor the process. After all, that's what you've been doing all her life, I suspect.<br><br>If you're like me, the mother of an adored and indulged child who has owned your heart for the past twentysomething years, you remember every single minute. You remember what her toddler voice sounded like when she laughed. You remember the little-girl smell of her, and dresses that were too expensive but you bought them anyway because you just had to see her in that adorable smocked pinafore. You remember the feel of her tiny&#x2014;usually sticky&#x2014;hand in yours as you took her into unfamiliar situations: A swimming pool. Kindergarten. The IMAX. A petting zoo. Her first piano recital. The dentist. You remember the victory dance she did to celebrate accomplishments from winning a race in a swim meet to learning cursive writing in the third grade. You remember laughing so hard your sides ached, and holding her when she cried, willing to trade your soul to keep her from hurting. You remember how much she loved goodnight kisses, how much she hated black olives, and how very sure she was that you would always be the center of her world.<br><br>And then, before you know it, this poised and accomplished young woman appears&#x2014;seemingly out of nowhere&#x2014;with a young man at her side. And not just any young man. <i>The </i>young man. Prince Charming. The forever guy.<br><br>They have Big News. They can't wait to tell you. Turns out Prince Charming has even been conspiring with your husband, arranging the surprise proposal, the whirlwind romantic weekend, the start of plans that are about to consume you for the next sixteen months.<br><br>All right, so you're not the center of her world anymore. You're the Mother of the Bride. Even the phrase itself makes you sound old. Dowdy.<br><br>But here's a secret: you're in for the time of your life.<br><br>ELIZABETH<br><br>EARLY MARCH<br><br>"So, my publisher just called and asked if there are any dates this summer when I won't be able to go on a book tour," said my mom.<br><br>I have this habit&#x2014;which I believe is absolutely adorable and endearing&#x2014;of calling my mother every time I'm walking anywhere. <i>The </i>result is that we speak at least four or five times a day, and she's gotten into the habit of answering phone calls from me with, "Where are you walking?" This particular conversation happened one morning as I hiked the five blocks between my bus stop and work.<br><br>My mom got a weird tone in her voice and continued. "And...I'm just telling yoo-oooou about my summer planssss..." (in a singsong voice) "...because I was wondering if there might be any sort of, you know, <i>event </i>around that time. You know, like a family event here in Seattle that I will have to attend because it will be a <i>very big deal for our family?</i>"<br><br>"Er..."<br><br>"Your wedding, Elizabeth."<br><br>Right. There was just one problem. One of the parties involved&#x2014;namely, Dave&#x2014;was not exactly down with the whole wedding thing. Oh, I'm pretty sure he had plenty of hopes, dreams, expectations, maybe even obsessions about building a future with me. But, like most guys, he played his cards close to the vest and he wasn't fond of showing his hand. Not even to me, the love of his life.<br><br>This was starting to grate on my mother. She held her tongue and cultivated patience, and I did my best to follow her example.<br><br>But okay, I'll just say it. Listen up, ladies. When it's time, it's time.<br><br>The man of your dreams gets a grace period, but by definition, a grace period has an end point. Dave's was quickly approaching.<br><br>After reassuring my mother that, indeed, she would be the first person to know upon my engagement to Dave, my Canadian boyfriend whom I met in college, I changed the subject so that we wouldn't jinx anything. I understood her concern. Dave and I had recently decided to move to Chicago for him to attend law school. As usual, I didn't really have a plan for myself beyond being blond, watching every riveting moment of <i>The View </i>and waiting for my dream job to fall into my lap.<br><br>Unlike the fictional gals in my mom's books, I was not a spunky-yet-lovable virgin trying to save the family ranch in the face of staggering adversity, all the while raising her dead sister's children and dallying with some tattooed bad boy named Rusty or Ryder.<br><br>I was a real, actual person. Maybe a lot like you&#x2014;just out of school, crazy in love, trying to make sense out of my life.<br><br>So, yeah, I was also wondering if this new level of commitment&#x2014;namely, picking up and moving to the Windy City&#x2014;would result in an engagement. (Spoiler: It did.)<br><br>Later that evening, Dave and I walked home hand-in-hand. I was a bit tipsy because we had joined friends for happy hour and I gracelessly steered our conversation to the upcoming wedding of two of our closest friends. HINT, HINT, Dave. When he acted clueless, I brought up the conversation I'd had with my mom about her summer plans. "You know," I slurred, "my mom was asking when we were going to get engaged.ha ha, isn't that HILARIOUS?"<br><br>Dave shot me a sidelong glance and said, "Don't talk to her about it so much. I want it to be natural, not something that our families push us into doing."<br><br>See, here's the cute thing about Dave. As the middle son of three boys, he doesn't have a clue about the mother-daughter bond. He doesn't understand that my mother has been party to every single detail of our relationship since before we even began dating. In fact, she was the one who logged into my Facebook account senior year of college, spotted his devastatingly handsome profile picture, and "poked" him on my behalf.<br><br>This is the kind of thing that lends credence to the old adage, "Mother Knows Best." Because that poke led to a silly online flirtation, which led to a silly in-person flirtation, which led to me finding my soul's puzzle piece in the form of a 6-foot-4 Canadian runner with a mane of shoulder-length, blond hair. Frickin' awesome. Cue the make-out session I mentioned earlier. My mom couldn't write it better in one of her books. And the Davester had no idea it all started with a click of my mom's mouse.<br><br>So when Dave asked me to avoid talking to my mom about the prospect of a proposal, I nodded and kept my mouth shut. The poor guy didn't have a clue. My mother had been the puppet-master of our relationship since before he even knew I existed. I just counted us lucky that we actually did find true love with one another in spite&#x2014;or perhaps <i>because</i>&#x2014;of my mother's meddling.<br><br>Here's a hint about your mom&#x2014;the older you get, the smarter she seems.<br><br>MARCH 14<br><br>"What do you want for your birthday, honey?"<br><br>Another conversation with my mom, this one on the way home from work nine days before my twenty-fourth birthday. Please note that there is nothing special about this day. It's not the Ides of March. Valentine's Day is long past. St. Paddy's Day, Easter, Arbor Day, Cinco de Mayo, Talk Like a Pirate Day...none of these most sacred feasts falls on March 14. It's the most random of days. The sort of day from which you expect nothing but the usual ambulatory phone call with your mother.<br><br>"Well, I feel like it's bad luck to say this." I began, "but all I really want is for Dave to propose to me. I can't stop thinking about it!"<br><br>A string of promising holidays had come and gone, leaving me deflated. I had no doubt that he loved me, but he didn't seem to be in a hurry to take the next obvious step.<br><br>I had secretly begged Santa for a ring, but clearly, he didn't get the memo. Then I thought maybe New Year's Eve would be The Moment. Lots of couples got engaged on New Year's Eve, right? But no, all I got on New Year's was a hoarse voice from karaoke performances of "Super Freak," and a raunchy hangover. Then came Valentine's Day, the ultimate date with destiny. Half the married people I know got engaged on Valentine's Day. But when February 14 rolled around, Dave wrote me a beautiful, loving letter and bought me a giant steak. There was no diamond buried in the meat, though. Undaunted, I studied the calendar for the Next Big Special Day. I have a March birthday, so that was a possibility, but I figured I would <i>know </i>if Dave was thinking about proposing, and a little voice in my head told me that he would be waiting until we were settled into our new home in Chicago the following year.<br><br>My mom, clearly, shared my view.<br><br>I could hear her snort on the phone. "He's not going to propose for your birthday," she said in her most matter-of-fact, I-know-everything voice. <i>"Trust </i>me. I would know. Your father is incapable of keeping a secret from me, and he hasn't said a word about a proposal."<br><br>"But...maybe Dave's just being really secretive...?"</p><h2>Wooden Boats</h2><p>A Wooden Boat demands a lot of time - but rewards you richly with memorable experiences.

Geoffrey Miller is one of the Young Turks trying to give the phenomenon a better spin. In <i>The Mating Mind</i>, he takes Darwin's "other" evolutionary theory--of sexual rather than natural selection--and uses it to build a theory about how the human mind has developed the sophistication of a peacock's tail to encourage sexual choice and the refining of art, morality, music, and literature.<p> Where many evolutionary psychologists see the mind as a Swiss army knife, and cognitive science sees it as a computer, Miller compares it to an entertainment system, evolved to stimulate other brains. Taking up the baton from studies such as Richard Dawkins' <i>The Selfish Gene</i>, it's a dizzyingly ambitious project, which would be impossibly vague without the ingenuity and irreverence that Miller brings to bear on it. Steeped in popular culture, the book mixes theories of runaway selection, fitness indicators, and sensory bias with explanations of why men tip more than women and how female choice shaped (quite literally) the penis. It also extols the sagacity of Mary Poppins. Indeed, Miller allows ideas to cascade at such a torrent that the steam given off can run the risk of being mistaken for hot air).</p><p> That large personalities can be as sexually enticing as oversize breasts or biceps may indeed prove comforting, but denuding sexual chemistry can be a curiously unsexy business, akin to analyzing humor. As a courting display of Miller's intellectual plumage, though, <i>The Mating Mind</i> is formidable, its agent-provocateur chest swelled with ideas and articulate conjecture. While occasionally his magpie instinct may loot fool's gold, overall it provides an accessible and attractive insight into modern Darwinism and the survival of the sexiest. <i>--David Vincent, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Follow me on twitter @matingmind</p><h2>Marine Radionavigation and Communications</h2><p>Designed for those who make their living on the sea or who navigate offshore for recreation, this comprehensive textbook introduces the mariner to each navigation and communication system and outlines its uses and limitations in practical application.

It is only by learning to relate to our emotions skillfully that we benefit from their richness and glean wisdom, rather than letting them control us. Emotions get their power from a simple but deep-seated source: our lack of self-knowledge. When we bring awareness to our experience of emotions, something truly amazing happens&#x2014;they lose their power to make us miserable.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this book,&nbsp;Rinpoche leads us through the three steps of his Emotional Rescue Plan. Mindful Gap is the practice of creating a safe distance between you and your emotions, which gives you the psychological space to work with their energy. Clear Seeing involves recognizing the bigger picture. Last, Letting Go is the practice of releasing stressful physical and emotional energy through exercise, relaxation, and awareness. With each step, we become increasingly familiar with the inner workings of our emotions, seeing straight to the heart of anger, fear, passion, jealousy, and pride. With time and practice, instead of leading us astray, our emotions become our guide towards living a more compassionate, creative, and fulfilling life.</p><p><b>Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche</b> is a widely celebrated Buddhist teacher and the author of <i>Rebel Buddha: A Guide to a Revolution of Mind</i>.

Until now. Downsized from his job, Devore is slipping away: from his wife, his family, and from all civilized norms of behavior. He wants his life back, and will do anything to get it. In this relentlessly fascinating novel, the masterful Westlake takes readers on a journey of obsession and outrage inside a quiet man&#39;s desperate world.</p><p>Donald E. Westlake, justly named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America, has written everything from comic capers (the Dortmunder series) to the darker adventures of ace criminal Parker during his long career. But he's never come up with anything scarier or more timely than this story about a downsized executive who decides to kill off the competition. Burke Devore could be your neighbor: a laid-off paper company manager watching his life and family fall apart as he tries desperately to get a job. The plan he finally comes up with involves murdering seven men very much like himself, and Westlake's most impressive achievement is to make the serial killings understandable if in no way justified. Selected titles from Westlake's vast list of books available in paperback include: <i>Baby, Would I Lie?</i>, <i>The Fugitive Pigeon</i>, <i>Pity Him Afterwards</i>, and <i>Trust Me on This</i>.Burke Devore is a paper company manager, a man who can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about bleaching processes and the edible wood pulp they put in ice cream.

Burke Devore wants his life back. And he will do anything to get it. Donald E. Westlake has written a tale of dark, mesmerizing power about one quiet, ordinary victim of corporate downsizing - who reacts in a most extraordinary way. From his attempts to land a new job, to the growing rift between him and his loved ones, Devore knows that he is running out of time. Believing that there is just one way to earn the only job he has a chance of getting, he sets off on a path from which there can be no turning back - no matter how bizarre and violent, no matter who gets in the way; no matter how evil Burke Devore becomes. Burke Devore is gunning for his competition, and it&#39;s getting easier every time...</p><h2>Young Men &amp; Fire/a True Story of the Mann Gulch Fire (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)</h2><p>A witness to the Montana Mann Gulch fire of 1949 explores the mysteries of the tragedy, with eyewitness accounts, new evidence, and research from fire scientists</p><p>A work that consumed 14 years of Maclean's life, and earned a 1992 National Book Critics Circle Award, <i>Young Men and Fire</i> tells the story of a Rocky Mountain forest fire that that claimed the lives of 13 young smoke jumpers on August 5, 1949, at Mann Gulch, Montana. The firefighters perished in a "blowup"--an explosive, 2,000-degree firestorm 300 feet deep and 200 feet tall. The excruciating detail of this book makes for a sobering reading experience. Maclean--a former University of Chicago English professor and avid fisherman--also wrote <i>A River Runs Through It and Other Stories</i>, which is set along the Missouri River, one gulch downstream from Mann.On August 5, 1949, a crew of fifteen Smokejumpers, the United States Forest Service&#39;s elite airborne firefighters, stepped into the sky above a remote forest fire in the Montana wilderness. Less than two hours after their jump, all but three of these men were dead or fatally burned. Exactly what happened in Mann Gulch that day has been obscured by years of grief and controversy. Now a master storyteller finally gives the Mann Gulch fire its due as tragedy. Norman Maclean first saw the Mann Gulch fire as it still burned in mid-August 1949, and even then he knew he would one day become a part of its story. Maclean spent the last fourteen years of his life studying and reliving the fire. Young Men and Fire is the long-awaited result, a story of Montana, of the ways of wildfires, firefighters, and fire scientists, and especially of a crew, young and proud, who &#34;hadn&#39;t learned to count the odds and to sense they might owe the universe a tragedy&#34;. This tale is also Maclean&#39;s own, the story of a writer obsessed by a strange and human horror, unable to let the truth die with these young men, searching for the last - and lasting - word. Nature&#39;s violence collides with human fallibility in Young Men and Fire. The Smokejumpers in Mann Gulch are trapped by a &#34;blowup&#34;, a deadly explosion of flame and wind rarely encountered and little understood at the time. Only seconds ahead of the approaching firestorm, the foreman, R. Wagner Dodge, throws himself into the ashes of an &#34;escape fire&#34; - and survives as his confused men run, their last moments obscured by smoke. The parents of the dead cry murder, charging that the foreman&#39;s fire killed their boys. Years later, Maclean returns to the scene with twoof the survivors and pursues the mysteries that Mann Gulch has kept hidden since 1949. From the words of witnesses, the evidence of history, and the research of fire scientists, Maclean at last assembles the scattered pieces of the Mann Gulch tragedy.</p><h2>I Can Make You Rich</h2><p>Are you ready to become rich?

A festive Christmas package left on Mariah&#x2019;s doorstep contains an ominous present, sparking memories of a twenty-year-old murder that shattered her friendship with the victim&#x2019;s widow. Though the gift is a bitter reminder of that tragic time, in the spirit of the season Mariah travels to Surrey in hopes of reconciling with her estranged friend and solving the crime that drove them apart.</p><p><b>Anne Perry</b> is the bestselling author of fourteen previous holiday novels, as well as the William Monk series and the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series set in Victorian England, five World War I novels, and a work of historical fiction, <i>The Sheen on the Silk</i>. Anne Perry lives in Los Angeles and Scotland.Christmas was just over a week away. Should Mariah Ellison bother the servants to put up some decorations in her rooms? No one else would see them, unless somebody paid her a call out of a sense of duty. Everybody in the family seemed to be away this Christmas, and Mariah was destined to be alone again. She forced from her mind the thought that it might be largely her own fault. She had been, to put it as kindly as possible, a trifle difficult. She had no doubt that, behind her back, it was put in harsher words.<br><br>Mariah had left her recent change of heart for rather late in life. She refused to count years, and had done for some time. In fact, she had stopped rather before eighty. That was more than old enough for any woman. If she had had any sense, she would have stopped at seventy! She knew many women who had. Queen Victoria was in her seventies, but then she could hardly be discreet about that! In fact, being Queen of a quarter of the world gave her very little discretion about anything at all, something for which Mariah did not envy her.<br><br>Being no one of any note allowed Mariah all the discretion she could wish for, and more.<br><br>She stood up and walked to the outer door of her rooms, and all the way to the front hallway of the main house. It was very grand, very beautiful. It belonged to her younger granddaughter, Emily, who had married extraordinarily well with her first husband, in fact above herself, in Mariah&#x2019;s opinion. But to be fair, Emily had made Mariah reasonably welcome, and she lacked nothing in the way of comfort. Since last Christmas, and her unusual adventure in Romney Marsh, when she had been obliged to stay with her daughter-ï¿½in-ï¿½law, Caroline, and Caroline&#x2019;s new husband, Mariah had appreciated a lot of things more than she had done in the past.<br><br>Emily had good taste, and since her first husband had died and left her rich, she had the means to exercise it. Mariah had always been satisfactorily cared for, but not on this scale.<br><br>The floor was pale marble, but a warm color, richly veined. The broad staircase swept down from an upper balcony, its wooden banister polished to a sheen, its newel post a work of art. Three blazing chandeliers hung from the high ceiling. The walls were decorated with paintings of aristocrats from earlier centuries. In Mariah&#x2019;s opinion it was a good place to put them, far better than in one of the rooms where people actually spent time, and would be obliged to look at them.<br><br>Although the family was away, there was still a good deal of decoration around: holly with bright berries, red and gold ribbons, colored candles, and in the corner of the hall a beautifully decorated Christmas tree.<br><br>She was admiring the charming details when there was a quiet cough behind her.<br><br>She turned to see the butler standing a few yards away.<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me, ma&#x2019;am, but there is rather a large parcel for you. Or rather, medium-ï¿½sized, but extremely heavy. Would you care for me to carry it to your rooms?&#x201d; he offered.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she accepted. Usually she carried a stick to assist her in walking. She had done so for years. It was not really necessary, but it was useful at times. It felt like a weapon, more of an attitude than any real service. She was perfectly steady on her feet, but it was good for leaning on now and then, and certainly for poking things, or people. The implication that she needed assistance made Emily&#x2019;s servants more attentive toward her.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, indeed!&#x201d; she went on.<br><br>The butler picked up the parcel, which seemed to require some effort. He carried it carefully across the hall toward the door to Mariah&#x2019;s quarters.<br><br>She had hoped there might be a letter for her, or better still, a Christmas card, but her disappointment was almost swallowed up by her curiosity as to what this heavy parcel might contain.<br><br>She walked behind him, out of the hall and along the passage to her own sitting room, where he set the parcel down on the table.<br><br>&#x201c;Would you care for me to open it, Mrs. Ellison?&#x201d; he asked. It did look particularly well sealed and was tied with several rounds of string.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, please.&#x201d; Her hands were a little arthritic; she was bound to be far slower than he, and by now she could hardly wait to know what was inside all this paper and string.<br><br>The butler produced a small penknife from his pocket and opened it to cut through the string, then the paper.<br><br>She watched him with fascination. There seemed to be layers and layers of strong, brown paper around whatever it was. But finally the last layer was undone and they both stood staring at a round, dark brown Christmas pudding. It was ordinary, totally traditional, with a flattened leaf of holly on the top. She could smell the richness of it, now that the wrapping was off.<br><br>&#x201c;Very nice, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; the butler said, looking at the pudding, then up at her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just surprised at how heavy it felt. Would you like me to take it to the kitchen, ma&#x2019;am? You&#x2019;ll be wanting to keep it until the day.&#x201d;<br><br>She frowned. Who on earth would send her a Christmas pudding? There must be a note somewhere. She stepped forward to lift the pudding.<br><br>&#x201c;Good gracious!&#x201d; she exclaimed. &#x201c;It feels like lead. What on earth have they put in it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed it does, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; he agreed.<br><br>Curiosity overwhelmed her. She went to the sideboard drawer and took out a knife. She poked the pudding and, within an inch or less, met with total resistance.<br><br>&#x201c;May I help, Mrs. Ellison?&#x201d; the butler offered.<br><br>She did not need a butler&#x2019;s help to cut a Christmas pudding. She jabbed the knife hard and achieved nothing at all. Whatever was blocking it was absolutely solid.<br><br>Very gently he took the knife from her and tried his own hand at it. He also got no farther than the first inch. He stopped, uncertain what he should do.<br><br>Mariah reached out, took the knife from him, and determinedly cut a couple of inches away from the original place. She met with the same resistance, and started to knock the pudding off, away from whatever the obstruction was.<br><br>The butler stared in amazement as she slowly uncovered a totally spherical ball of lead, about seven or eight inches in diameter.<br><br>&#x201c;What on earth is that?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Mariah felt a sudden chill of memory, indistinct, just sadness, and fear. It was absurd.<br><br>&#x201c;It looks like a cannonball,&#x201d; she said a little tartly. &#x201c;Except it is too small to be a real one.&#x201d; She poked at it again, and then pushed to see if it would roll. It was solid, and too heavy to do more without a considerable effort behind the push.<br><br>&#x201c;Is it one of those ornamental ones?&#x201d; the servant asked, staring at it, his face creased with puzzlement.<br><br>Inside her mind the memory was suddenly complete. That is exactly what it was: an ornamental cannonball, made of lead just as the real ones were. No wonder it was extraordinarily heavy. She stared at it as if mesmerized, while waves of the past engulfed her like a cold sea.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you all right, Mrs. Ellison?&#x201d; he said with concern. &#x201c;Would you like to sit down? I&#x2019;ll take this away and fetch you a cup of tea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; she said quickly. Then, remembering the new person she had determined to be, she added, &#x201c;Thank you. You might look to see if there is any note with it, even on the outside wrapping. I believe I know where it came from, but I would like to be certain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Obediently he picked up all the pieces of paper and examined them on both sides, putting them in a neat pile when he had finished. He kept one in his hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, don&#x2019;t stand here!&#x201d; Her voice was tight in her throat. &#x201c;What does it say?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just the postmark of where it&#x2019;s from, ma&#x2019;am. There&#x2019;s no more.&#x201d;<br><br>She gulped. Her throat was dry. It was twenty years ago now, almost exactly.<br><br>&#x201c;Haslemere?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>His eyes widened. &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am, that&#x2019;s exactly what it says.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you. You&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; She looked at his pale face, so stiff, so earnest. &#x201c;You may take it to the kitchen. Perhaps you would have someone remove the bit of pudding from the outside. If it is edible, you are welcome to it. And have the cannonball put in the garden shed, if you please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.
